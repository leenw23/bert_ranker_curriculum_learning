I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up. __eou__ that will be cool , are you looking at any schools to go to ? __eou__ I have my eyes on a few but I have to discuss it with my parents __eou__ It is pretty expensive to go to get this type of schooling and it takes a while , but I feel you will enjoy it .  __eou__ I hope so. What do you do for work? __eou__ I am a artist and I farm I have cattle ,pigs, a few horse.It is nice __eou__ That seems like a good life to live to be self sufficient  __eou__ Yes it is but it is hard work, there is a lot to be done feeding wise, but artist wise I love it , __eou__ I am envious of you, I hope to have a life like that some day __eou__ yes I could work in a factory but I like being my own boss 
i had helped him to secure a good job, and he became rich, One day he saw me discussing with his fiancee, he didnt ask question first, he just came there and slapped me, we now engaged in a serious fight __eou__ That is such a bizarre story. __eou__ It truly is bizarre. __eou__ Did you end up getting hurt in the fight and suing him? __eou__ I did end up getting hurt and dumping him. __eou__ You are better off without him.  You should definitely marry someone in the military.  We are honorable people.  __eou__ I found my husband after that garbage happened. __eou__ That's great news!  Where did you meet your husband?  I met mine while stationed in Hawaii.  We are both serving in the military.  __eou__ I met him in a business meeting. I run my own consulting firm. __eou__ What do you consult on?

Plus, men in jumpsuits are just hot! Ha Ha __eou__ Thank you for your service. __eou__ That is kind of you.  Thank you!   The military has a large marketing budget.  You should check into trying to get a contract with them. 
i hate my parents alot __eou__ i really have a good time they think young __eou__ I've been thinking about them a lot, especially on my long drive to and from work. They make me crazy. __eou__ how so? __eou__ They are hoarders. They hang on to everything. Going from the kitchen to the living room is like going through a junk yard! __eou__ do you live with them still? that sounds rough __eou__ My mom is disabled and my father is getting senile, so they live with me and my family.  __eou__ that has to be rough. props to you for stepping up like that.  __eou__ Thanks, as much as they drive me crazy, I don't want them to end up in a nursing home. It's just tough some days. What are your parents like? __eou__ Difficult. We don't see eye to eye on a lot, but they don't live with me so its easier __eou__ I understand. My dad and I don't agree about anything. Arguing is our favorite father/son activity lol __eou__ I try to put limits on it. Or make excuses to get off the phone. __eou__ I wish I could still do that! Living together makes escape difficult. I usually go out to the barn and hang out with the horses to get a break. __eou__ its nice that you have a place to go. i don't know how i'd get by with my mom in the same apartment. 
I have heard it gets awesome mileage but is expensive __eou__ Well the Toyota Prius is a full hybrid electric automobile so its got its advantages. __eou__ I should look into buying one. I would probably save money on gas in the long run. __eou__ Sure would, kinder on the environment too :)  __eou__ I need to get my Father to drive one. He lives in a place where pollution is a major problem. __eou__ Yeah cleaner air can make a difference for sure. It's surprising what makes you happy.  __eou__ Yeah. My father in in China right now. It makes him happy. Do you like to travel? __eou__ Love to travel. China is one my favourite places, who doesn't love cute Pandas?  __eou__ Lol. I know I do.

Also enjoyed hiking volcanoes. __eou__ I would love to hike near a volcano. What is your favorite place to hike? __eou__ Mt Kilimajaro.

I love hiking the Appalachian trail.  __eou__ Not done that myself but would love to one day, I've heard many great things about it.
wow good for you . about one week . what color ? __eou__ i dyed it black for a role . __eou__ Do you like dogs __eou__ Yeah, I absolutely love them, how about you? __eou__ When you said you dyed it black for a role it reminded me of my favorite black dog __eou__ Ah, makes sense, is he or she still around today? __eou__ No, unfortunately he passed away while I was at work one day.  __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that, that must've been a rough thing to come home to. __eou__ Yeah, it was but I will always remember him.  __eou__ That's good at least, it's hard to forget them since they end up feeling so much like family. __eou__ Oh yeah that is for sure and because of my job I could not get back right away when he was sick __eou__ Yeah, it's tough balancing work and pets at times __eou__ Do you have a hard time with that too? __eou__ I used to. Without my husband I don't think I would still have any pets
Me too! It is so nice around here, I don't like the city life. __eou__ technically speaking they say anything not urban is considered rural, that does not sound right to me __eou__ I agree, suburban is a category too __eou__ I agree, that's why I favor smaller towns opposed to big cities. Just not my thing. __eou__ I don't like huge cities, too much traffic. __eou__ i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem __eou__ Where was that? __eou__ new york  but i recently bought a lottery ticket. __eou__ I have never been to New York but would like to visit. Did you win the lottery ticket? __eou__ Yes, enough that i work for myself now!  No more checking in and no more traffic hassles! __eou__ That sounds like an awesome job!  __eou__ it is..i love the freedoms :) __eou__ Can you work from home? __eou__ Yes i do! just need an internet connection wth good speed and good computer
awesome , what major ? mine was american literature and education __eou__ computer sciences . i work as a software engineer . __eou__ and i work as an accountant __eou__ how do you enjoy working as an accountant? __eou__ i do enjoy dealing with money,lol! __eou__ well you and I have that in common! however I am not overly financially literate, I don't think I could do that job __eou__ why? though you need to be highly literate to do accounting it needs a lot of operations __eou__ I have heard sometimes it can be boring __eou__ yes it can..you know doing same routines everyday for many years. __eou__ yes, I like having a new challenge everyday in my work __eou__ yes we all could love that.but it happens very rarely. __eou__ I find being a software engineer always makes me think in new ways, I enjoy it __eou__ i find your job great too. __eou__ Yes, it has it's ups and downs
Something is under my bed and keeps me up at night! __eou__ What!? My god sounds like a horror movie. You better move.  __eou__ I'm convinced it's some sort of spirit! __eou__ That is terrifying have you looked under there? __eou__ No!  I'm too afraid.  What's if it's something terrible and I have to move?  I love my neighborhood.  There are tons of great vegan restaurants. __eou__ It could just be a rodent or something. I'm a pest controller you would be surprised at some of my stories. __eou__ I hadn't thought about that!  What's the scariest thing you've ever found on a job? __eou__ Giant rats are pretty scary to some people. I kind of hate my job though I want to quit and explore the world. __eou__ I don't blame you.  What's your dream vacation? __eou__ I want to visit the great barrier reef. Have you heard of it? __eou__ I've heard of it but have never been.  You should go! __eou__ I think I just might. I hope you figure out whatever is under your bed. __eou__ Thanks!  Good luck with the job.  Hope you get to the GBR! __eou__ i'll do my best ! well it has been great chatting with you ! see you around !
My cat ignores me sometimes and just stares into the distance __eou__ Cats can be odd creatures __eou__ i dont understand what these creatures could be looking at  __eou__ It could honestly be staring at anything! My German Sheppard I think see's straight into my soul. __eou__ honestly I'm more of a dog person. my dogs crazy. haha __eou__ I can definitely relate, but Spock (my dog) definitely loves the beach. I take him surfing with me all the time! __eou__ oh thats fun!! I take my dog Dexter, to the river alot. __eou__ My friends cat's name is Dexter. Did you name him from the show? __eou__ No, I just liked the name, well famous dex may have had some minor influence. __eou__ Touché! I did love that show though. Do you surf? __eou__ No theres not really surfing where i'm from, too cold. __eou__ There is definitely fun stuff to do in the cold though, have you ever snowboarded? It's surfing on land if you ask me. __eou__ thats true! and i do snowboard, I love it !  i seem to get injured every time i go though. __eou__ You and me both! But I can take a little pain for the excitement of the slopes. 
How many species of this fish are there? __eou__ There are two of them. One in most tropical to temperate oceans, the other is in the Southern Ocean south of 34 degrees South __eou__ You know a lot about fishes, what is your job? __eou__ I am an aquarium builder, it's a passion:) __eou__ Great, must be really nice job working at aquarium. I'm a graphic designer. __eou__ I always wish I was good at design. I've tried, but I'm pretty garbage, haha! __eou__ I've never been really talented too, I've just wanted to be designer so I've worked hard on myself and learned a lot of things. __eou__ I've always believed hard work equals talent if you have the passion. It sounds like you have plenty of it.  __eou__ I believe in that too! Thanks, It's great to hear something like this. __eou__ I never thought I would be doing what I am. I certainly didn't know much about it. But through work and research I'm doing what I love.  __eou__ I've read a great quote today...Do what you love and you will never work a day in your life. __eou__ For sure, that is a motto to live by! I wouldn't dream of doing anything different. __eou__ Mine too. And what are other things you like? __eou__ i like doing outdoor stuff. I love the mountains and river rafting. 
i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door __eou__ Oh no, how big is the dent? __eou__ The dent is hugeee. __eou__ Oh no! Will your insurance cover it? __eou__ Yes it will. I am so glad I paid for good coverage. __eou__ That's cool. My dad would kill me if I came home with a dent in his car. I don't have my own car yet. __eou__ As long as you know that cars die, it isn't too costly. __eou__ i hope so . my dad needs let me use the car more . you live on your own ? __eou__ I do actually. Freedom is very nice. __eou__ I can't wait until I'm old enough. I love my parents, but I want to do things my way!  __eou__ It's not an easy road. My advice is to always be prepared. __eou__ Well, I have $500 in savings and I have a part-time job at the movie theater, so I'm prepared for just about anything. __eou__ Just keep adding on. __eou__ I do pretty good in school, but I'm not going to college. I want to be a professional UFC fighter!
I was so shocked when my great grandpa visited the other day. He never leaves his house. __eou__ That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home? __eou__ Wow! What was the special occasion that got him out of the house? __eou__ Do you usually go to visit him instead? __eou__ Yes, I do try to visit him every week.  He has social anxiety which keeps him home.   __eou__ Good for you. Family's real important. I try to get out to visit mine whenever I can even if I'm busy __eou__ Very true!  I love shopping online, so I have been trying to teach him how to use Amazon Pantry for his groceries but he is resistant to change.  __eou__ At that age? No surprise. Maybe you could order for him?  __eou__ I probably could, but he prefers me to go into the store for him.  He is 73, so I doubt he will change.  Do you like shopping online? __eou__ Old people are often the hardest to get to adopt new things. I do most of my shopping online, yeah __eou__ True!  I would rather curl up with a good fantasy novel than go into a grocery store!  __eou__ It certainly frees up time, both for work and play. I work long enough hours as is without extra chores __eou__ Definitely.  Where do you work? __eou__ A marketing firm out of Houston
Yeah, I agree. Learning new things can help you grow as a person and can be fun too  __eou__ I think that learning through play is an important part of childhood development. __eou__ yes it is , it gives them skills they need when they get older __eou__ I think just about any situation can be made into a learning game.  As long as you don't mind being silly sometimes __eou__ I feel that more parents and teachers could learn from children sometimes they forget they were little.Don't you ? __eou__ I think adults could learn from children __eou__ Children are more open to what they understand , where a adult will not look at it that way , __eou__ i agree.  kids soak up everything __eou__ the sure do , it is like a sponge, and than there some people try and change them ,I feel children lean to be smart by learning .  __eou__ No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts. __eou__ that sure is right , that is why it is better to let a child see things ,and that is why people need to remember they were little  __eou__ yes , that is absolutely right . do you have a family ? __eou__ I have a older son who is arctic and he is really smart builds computers , but they did not understand him at school   __eou__ he sounds resourceful.  i bet he will find work that will be fullfilling some day
I'm so proud of my friend! __eou__ oh why was that? did he/she do anything exceptionally? __eou__ Yes, he did exceptionally, he join the soccer team __eou__ Awesome! Is he getting plenty of playing time? __eou__ Oh yes, he is getting plenty of playng time.  __eou__ Xbox? :) __eou__ No, he actually goes and plays withe hes team. He trains 3 times a week. __eou__ Sounds like he's having a great week. How's yours been so far? __eou__ Yes, he is, I am happy for him. Mine its been a ggod week I actually just came back from vacation. How is your week?
Someone broke into our new home, I couldn't believe it. __eou__ Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything? __eou__ Yeah, they stole both of my laptops __eou__ Oh no. That's scary. Are you ok? __eou__ Yeah, I think so.  It just is a little disappointing.  I have chocolate to keep me distracted. __eou__ Chocolate is a good distraction. What kind of chocolate do you have? __eou__ Hershey's.  It's okay, but I prefer Reese's.  __eou__ I love Reese's! Best chocolate ever! __eou__ Yeah! I just wish it wasn't so unhealthy. __eou__ I know. They have a lot of sugar free candy out now. I tried it. It's not so bad.  __eou__ Interesting... I will have to look into that.  I eat way more sugar than I know I need. __eou__ Don't feel bad. I do too. But I'll grab some sugar free candy from time to time.  __eou__ What kind of sugar free candy is there? __eou__ I've seen sugar free Jolly Ranchers and sugar free Turtles. 
I start school tomorrow. __eou__ Are you excited? __eou__ very excited of course __eou__ What are you going to study in school?

Tons of options near my home. __eou__ wooow,you are lucky to have them. __eou__ Yes.  Maine is beautiful in the Fall.  Where are you going to school? __eou__ i would like a visit there.it seems really beautiful __eou__ You should!  It is terribly cold in winter though.  Do you like cold weather? __eou__ i can imagine how cold it can be. __eou__ It doesn't bother me too much.  I suppose I'm used to it.
It seems like it would hard to get the supplies and ingredients needed. But I like having a hobby or two. __eou__ I know. When I do it, I am like I am doing something that has been going on for over 7000 years.  __eou__ that is true, it is one of the most basic of human activities __eou__ It is impressive but also time consuming and difficult. __eou__ I can imagine, sometimes I much prefer just sitting and watching television __eou__ Yeah, it can seem daunting and TV is excellent for escapism. __eou__ my favorite is the walking dead, how about you? __eou__ The walking dead's great, although I'm a bit behind. I'm currently looking for something new to watch. __eou__ I highly recommend it, however everything on amc is good television __eou__ Yeah I saw Halt and Catch Fire on AMC, that was great. I still haven't gotten around to setting up my TV in my new house. __eou__ how long ago did you move? __eou__ Just a week ago. The rooms are still littered with boxes.  __eou__ oh wow, yes it takes some time to get settled __eou__ Yeah, we are still trying to get everything sorted out.
My daughter's chihuahua was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease about a month after we had her.  She did pretty good with it for quite awhile. __eou__ im so sorry to hear that __eou__ It will be expensive to treat as I only work part time right now at an aldi store. __eou__ I am sure she will be okay __eou__ Hopefully, I'm trying to take my daughter mind of off it. We are watching our favorite movie together, Titanic. __eou__ What is the movie about? __eou__ A ship from the early 1900s at sunk in the Atlantic ocean. I'm surprised you've never heard of it. __eou__ i did not know that but i have seen the movie __eou__ It's considered one of the greatest movies of all time. __eou__ It is a very nice movie. __eou__ It has been my favorite since it released in 1997 __eou__ Good to see your interest. I too fond of this movie. __eou__ Do you enjoy any other movies? __eou__ I do enjoy other movies. I am more into comedies.
yeah , i my hubby makes my life easier too . life is different than before them . __eou__ i hear you . life is incomplete ever since my dog passed . __eou__ OH i am so sorry to hear that :( __eou__ Thank you for your concern. It has been hard, but I will do my best to move forward. __eou__ we dont have any pets...just husband and two teen aged boys. __eou__ Well, considering how much work a couple teen boys can be, you probably don't have any time to spare for pets. __eou__ yes...i had cats years ago before i had kids...always wanted another cat but life got so busy...maybe when they move out __eou__ Cats are great for companions once you have an empty nest, for sure. No worries, I'm sure someday you will be able to get another furry friend. :) __eou__ we all get along great....it probably wouldnt be a big deal but we have so many activities i feel they'd get neglected __eou__  Luckily, cats tend to do their own thing, hence why they make great pets for busy people. __eou__ this is true!! you can even leave them for short periods...like overnight and they are pretty chill.  __eou__ Absolutely! Unlike dogs, who NEED you constantly. haha __eou__ true! and they dont do well with a liter box..lol __eou__ The day I see a dog use a litter box is the day I buy a camera for sure. heh heh __eou__ HAHAHA! me too!
I just mesmerized with the kid's performance. __eou__ yeah that kid were more lovely and attractive. i was love kids __eou__ It's amazing how much talent is in the world! I can't believe how young some of them are! __eou__ yes , definitely very talented . what else do you enjoy ? __eou__ I enjoy garderning. I have a few rose bushes. They are a pain to take care of but so beautiful. __eou__ Did the plants grow up to be big and strong? __eou__ They definitely are! I have a few scrapes to prove it. They are not the easiet to make happy or take care of. Dang thorns! lol __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that! love gardening, it's so relaxing! __eou__ Oh it's worth it. I have the best ones on the block. I also have a veggy and herb garden as well. So you have a garden as well? __eou__ I do! I grow a lot of different vegetables and herbs that I like to use for cooking. __eou__ It is nice to run out the to garden and get what you need! It's awesome. I make tea with the herbs and well eat the vegetables:) __eou__ Thats great I love tea made from fesh leaves __eou__ Pepermint it my favorite. Nothing quite like it. I've tried store bought and it just isn't the same. __eou__ Yea peppermint is great, I like Ginger and Lemon as well 
Yeah!  I've told her if she ever decides to move somewhere cool to do that I want to go too. __eou__ America is pretty big though, with 3.8 million square miles, you have to find somewhere nice o call home! __eou__ I would like to find a place to relax and work on cars. I love cars. What about you? __eou__ I want to get a car one day i think. __eou__ Well when you do get a car I would be happy to help with any questions or problems. That's my area of expertise. __eou__ Great that is good news, I dont know much about cars __eou__ I have been a mechanic for many years.  What do you do for work? __eou__ My brother wants to be an auto mechanic.I myself are a plumber. __eou__ My two cousins are plumbers. I almost became a plumber. How do you like it? __eou__ It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now. __eou__ It is a very respectable job. Plumbers save more lives than doctors because they maintain public health through preventing hygiene related disease. __eou__ i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective ! __eou__ It is always good to look at how you are benefiting society. I hope I am helping by keeping people on the road. __eou__ Not just working for yourself, but helping others too. Good on you!
I like it cooked medium rare to rare __eou__ I like mine well done only. I also prefer grilled steak to pan fried or broiled. It just tastes better on the grill. __eou__ Definitely!  Do you do the grilling or does your spouse? __eou__ At this point I am into grilling, preparing food over an open flame. __eou__ Awesome!  I need you to grill me some steaks too!   __eou__ Let me know the next time you are in town and I will do. Prepare to be dazzled. __eou__ I would love that!

My Grandparents are from Northern California. __eou__ We are going to LA, to Disneyland __eou__ That sounds so fun!  I should plan a winter vacation to a sunny state.  We don't get much sun during the winter here.  __eou__ Yea you should. What state are you living in? __eou__ Washington near Seattle.
i do enjoy crafting too ! __eou__ i like to make wreaths , wine glasses , shirts and more . you ? __eou__ A bit of painting in my spare time. __eou__ what kind of painting? I do digital art myself __eou__ Nice. I'm into oil portraiture, takes an age to dry but fun painting outdoors! __eou__ are you doing commissions or selling, or just as a hobby? __eou__ Just a hobby. My job is singing - barbershop and rap. What do you do? __eou__ Quite the combo. I'm trying to make in comics, but its tough __eou__ Yeah, I can imagine. Have you niche? Comics are super popular now with all the Marvel films. __eou__ It's true. Even indie comics are doing better, but its still a rough market.  __eou__ I used to read Poison Elves before it was bought out.  __eou__ I'm trying to pitch stuff to publishers now, but part of me is worried about losing creative control __eou__ There's always self publishing, that's a respectable route these days and gets you on ladder. __eou__ That's true. But it's harder to get distribution that way and you have to do a lot of marketting
I'm getting a new phone soon and I'm really looking forward to it! __eou__ Nice! Which one you getting? __eou__ I want to get a Samsung Galaxy. __eou__ That's a great choice.  __eou__ Samsung usually makes good products. __eou__ Yes they have had some hiccups in the past but for the most part they do. __eou__ I actually bought one of their TVs. __eou__ That must have been expensive __eou__ They are, but the picture is nice. __eou__ is it a 4K television? __eou__ It is. Rather nice. __eou__ There's a spider on my TV right now. I am terrified. __eou__ Oh nooo. Is it a big one? __eou__ It is rather large. It could be dangerous.
i watch it on tv but playing is more fun __eou__ I agree.  Watching is enjoyable to see the experts, but playing is great for personal health and exercise.  Very little has changed in the rules of tennis since 1890.  __eou__ i like watching tennis than playing. __eou__ Sure. Most people don't have the physical stamina for playing tennis. Much easier to watch. __eou__ yes,but i would like to play it once or twice. __eou__ practice can always help . but i'm sure competition might be intimidated . __eou__ Especially that __eou__ Is it expensive to get into or can you play tennis on the cheap? __eou__ yes obviously.i like watching golf too __eou__ Golf can be fun to watch. Depends on your tastes I suppose. I could never get into it. __eou__ the taste matters too.though it is difficult to play i bet __eou__ Of course. Golf takes a short time to learn but a long time to master. __eou__ yes,that is why i just enjoy watching than playing. __eou__ I hear you. Why play if even after all your practice you still can't compete?
i've a job that i enjoy so that helps . i actually love it __eou__ what job do you do ? __eou__ I manage a farm ,I like writing short children story's  __eou__ That's interesting.  What do you enjoy about writing?  I enjoy art myself. __eou__ I like to tell small story's about farm animals and the adventures that they have  __eou__ I bet kids love your stories.  How did you get started in writing? __eou__ My mom use to make up story's about the baby calves we raised when I was little  __eou__ That' s a really sweet memory.  My mom homeschooled us growing up so I have fond memories of her reading to me. __eou__ that is cool , was it fun learning like that did you have a lot of home work ? __eou__ It was okay. I missed out on stuff that other kids get to do in school. __eou__ I bet so , It would be different and not being around others did you have friends ? __eou__ Yeah.  There's an area club of sorts you can join.  I mostly met kids playing sports and taking art classes. __eou__ that was good , plus you did out some around others,there some little boys close to home that is home school they go to different places and learn things  __eou__ Do they ever come to your farm for field trips?
where do you go volunteer ? __eou__ at the red cross . __eou__ That is amazing. Great organization. I am trying to find a place to volunteer. I was thinking a local animal shelter.  __eou__ that is very nice of you . it is good to volunteer . __eou__ Everyone should do something for their community. I'm good with animals seems like it might be a good fit.  __eou__ I totally agree. It helps the shelters from overcrowding. __eou__ There are so many it has been a bit daunting trying to pick one to help out. __eou__ Yea well you just have to start somewhere. __eou__ I have narrowed it down a bit. So hopefully soon I will start doing it instead of just talking about it. __eou__ You should get on that soon. __eou__ You are right! Thanks I will! Guess I just needed someone to push me a bit:) __eou__ Yea, no doubt we all need a little push once in a while  __eou__ Sometimes it takes a perfect stranger to start a change for someone. Thanks! __eou__ no problem . life is about helping each other . you have made my evening less lonely __eou__ Glad to help! Have a great night!
Oh really, thats cool, what was your best time or average time? __eou__ My best 5k run time is so embarassing I'd rather not say. I curse the gods for the whole 3.1 miles. __eou__ lol Its ok you have to start somewhere, right. __eou__ True!

Yeah I did! Have you ever been to McDonalds before? __eou__ Not for a very long time.

I have no idea how long she's been doing this.  __eou__ Do you think there is any hope of saving your marriage? 5 years is a lot to give up on. __eou__ I don't know. I need to talk to her about it. She doesn't know that i know yet. Maybe we can goto counseling.  __eou__ That's going top be a tough conversation. I can't imagine having that talk with my wife. I hope it goes okay. __eou__ So for now I just need to collect my thoughts. __eou__ I understand. Are you sure it was ,"another man"? There is no way it's just a misunderstanding? __eou__ You're right. A photo isn't everything. I need to talk to her. __eou__ Definitely. I've been with my wife for 21 years and there have been a lot of misunderstandings. You should give her the benefit of the doubt.

I just preferred to be at home baking or sewing instead. __eou__ what do you sew? __eou__ I like to sew all sorts of things like pillows and blankets with stitches and a needle and thread. I try to sew items for homeless people as well.

Where are dangerous snakes found? __eou__ ugh spiders. can we not talk about those __eou__ Sure!  I don't really like them either.  I hate it when I walk through a spider web.  I'm on the tall side so it happens often. __eou__ every time i see a web i freak and search the whole house the idea that ones hiding is just. UGH  __eou__ You're really afraid, aren't you?  Is it a phobia?  I know people have those. __eou__ haha i guess its something like that.  __eou__ You should try immersion therapy or something.

If it's authentic, it will always cost more. __eou__ Most places like that are. I like to get 5.00 pizzas sometimes to save some money  __eou__ Absolutely no problem with that. I do the same. __eou__ I think you can to them if you want more on them , most of the time it is good the way it is __eou__ I always like more cheese, but it's a minimal cost. __eou__ Yes if they add to it they charge you a dollar more ,that is the way Snappy pizza does

Nice chatting with you. __eou__ Yeah its pretty good chatting with you, always good to find another Koala lover
I was alone a lot as a child. __eou__ That's unfortunate.  You must have been lonely.  Has your situation improved since then? __eou__ yes, my situation has improved, i have learned to enjoy being alone now and spend a lot of my time hiking. __eou__ Hiking is a wonderful hobby. Have you ever considered doing it in a group? __eou__ I have hiked in groups before but I think i prefer doing it by myself. It eliminates distractions and allows me to be fully submerged in nature. Do you hike? __eou__ not often, maybe i should more __eou__ I would recommend it. What do you do as a hobby? __eou__ i play badminton. im in a rec league but we take it pretty seriously __eou__ oh wow. that is neat. do you play singles or doubles? __eou__ i usually do singles, but sometimes we double up if there are a lot of people there __eou__ that is cool. how long have you been playing for? __eou__ a long time. i messed around with it as a kid but i got more serious in college __eou__ that sounds like a fun hobby to have. __eou__ it is, and good exercise too, a lot like hiking
Yeah, it's great. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. __eou__ You know, the full title is The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account) __eou__ i havent read that one...maybe i will get a copy...i can certainly afford it. __eou__ It is a very interesting story. Have you read any other Dickens novels? __eou__ well the christmas carol...but i suppose everyone has read that :) __eou__ That is a classic. I love the updated film version with Bill Murray. Have you seen it? __eou__ yes, but call me old fashioned, George C Scott was my favorite Scrooge __eou__ True. That is the best version. George C Scott is a great actor. He brought the character to life. __eou__ sometimes i compare my kids to scrooge...not what i thought they would be! __eou__ Kids can be a handful. How old are they? __eou__ in their 20s.  I think i let the family wealth go to their heads....probably my fault really __eou__ Don't feel too bad. We try our best as parents, right? __eou__ yes we do!  you have kids too i take it __eou__ Yes, just one. 2 years old. I hope he gets his mother's genes and becomes tall. Being short is no fun.
i am going to be the crazy cat lady . i already have 4 hahas __eou__ that's amazing . you might be an introvert ? __eou__ may son has 16 kittens right now they need a new home  __eou__ Thats a lot, I hope they all end up in decent homes, I've seen plenty end up in awful situations __eou__ oh I know people can be so mean to little animals ,they want to build a cat shelter in our town  __eou__ That would definitely be nice, I hear they generally take pretty good care of them in shelters __eou__ and find great homes for them , I could fill it up for them  __eou__ With all those kittens you could probably get some good progress on a second shelter even __eou__ I get food from the store that are in torn bags sometimes it takes a lot to feed all them little mouths  __eou__ Yeah that certainly can't be cheap __eou__ I live on a farm so there is plenty of room for them to roam around  __eou__ That's good at least, they must be very happy __eou__ I know one thing I don't have any mice  __eou__ That's definitely a plus, and they're cute too __eou__ they are cute little things 
oh that is cool but i am not a very good student . __eou__ i can help you in english . we can read jan austen together __eou__ not sure how much that'll help __eou__ what do you think would help you in english then? __eou__ not sure maybe im just dumb __eou__ i dont think you are dumb, you just need to spend time studying. what do you like to do with your free time? __eou__ idk not much. waste time mostly i guess __eou__ well you need to change that. I like to knit and I find that it helps me with focussing on things. You should try it! __eou__ yeah i guess. idk i was always really bad at sports and stuff so i guess i just gave up on hobbies __eou__ That's totally understandable. Hobbies definitely change over the years. It's always great to find what makes you happiest! __eou__ yeah dunno what that would be tho __eou__ You should try travelling maybe __eou__ maybe when im older but isn't that expensive __eou__ It can be, so book your flight a month or two out for the best pricing and stay in cheap places. Its a lot of fun!
that sounds like a fun place to live ! __eou__ it is , but i'd rather stay in and read a good book __eou__ Do you not like the cold weather there? __eou__ I do, I just don't want to be out in it.  __eou__ I would love to spend the day indoors reading.

How about you? __eou__ Psychological thrillers are my favorite! __eou__ I love psychological thrillers, any recommendations? __eou__ My most recent read was The Silent Patient, highly recommend. __eou__ Excellent, I will look out for it. who's it by?
I don't know much about it. Would you mind teaching me? __eou__ There are different types of yoga.  One of the more popular is Hatha. __eou__ Oh - what is the type of yoga where you do it in a hot room? __eou__ I think it's just called hot yoga. I hear it's really good for burning calories __eou__ Have you ever tried it? __eou__ I have not yet but I've definitely heard of it __eou__ Thats neat - I have a hard time burning calories since my favourite food is meatloaf and i eat a lot of it. __eou__ Oh meatloaf is amazing, I understand why you would want a lot __eou__ what is your favourite food? __eou__ That's gotta be mashed potatoes, they're soooo good __eou__ oh, I hear that! mashed potatoes and meatloaf are a delicious combo __eou__ The best combo some may say __eou__ do you cook them for yourself often? __eou__ Almost every day, I just can't get enough
how did you end up in a wheel chair __eou__ a four wheeler accident . __eou__ Sorry to hear that. I have heard four wheelers can be dangerous. __eou__ yes you have to be careful I learned the hard way ,on a slip on a hill __eou__ If that happened to me, my wife would take away my vehicle. Are you married? __eou__ No I am not , glad I am not it would be a burden on the marriage  __eou__ I understand. I get lectures from my wife all the time. Honestly I'm not afraid of what she thinks. Sometimes fun is worth an angry wife. __eou__ I bet you get in trouble a lot with your wife lol __eou__ Lol. She wears the pants in the family. But she makes great spaghetti so I can tolerate her. __eou__ that s so cool . spaghetti is alright that is one great meal do you garlic bread with it ? __eou__ Garlic bread and meatballs. I have to have meatballs with my spaghetti. What is your favorite food? __eou__ I like hamburgers with everything on them   __eou__ I like cheese burgers with bacon. Thanks for listening. __eou__ you are most welcome . . i hope you had a great day
I have.  I actually have played for a couple of seasons.  I normally use ESPN for my fantasy leagues __eou__ Cool, the players choose rosters during a draft at the beginning of the season where all NFL players are chosen. __eou__ these days i mostly play for fun though, not for money __eou__ I always play for money. I like the thrill of it. __eou__ I wonder if it'll ever get legislated as a type of gambling or betting. __eou__ I don't know. I assumed it was considered a legal form of gamblng already. What a coincidence that we both play. __eou__ There are actually surprisingly few regulations on it. I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with writing those laws though. __eou__ It feels so much like a fun game that I never really thought much about the regulations tbh. __eou__ I guess it's just a side effect of working in law. I even think about those user agreements before clicking accept __eou__ Ah, I see. I just do it because I can't get enough football, whether it's real or fantasy.  __eou__ Do you also play video games? __eou__ Not much these days. I started doing martial arts with my son and it takes up most of my "free" time. __eou__ That's nice that you have an activity to do with your kid. __eou__ Yes, not that puberty is starting, it's nice to have something that we enjoy doing together. And it keeps me fit.
Bought a laptop I really needed last month. The price went down by $200. Wish I would have waited. __eou__ I hate when that happens! Were you able to get a credit for it? __eou__ no, by the time i bought it there was not that sale __eou__ that is too bad. __eou__ i know!! __eou__ I need my laptop for my job as a professional translator, so I understand. __eou__ well is the moment to buy one, the prices are good now __eou__ That is good to know, I will have to look.  __eou__ do not miss the opportunity __eou__ What laptop brand did you get? __eou__ i got a mac  __eou__ Oh fancy! those do not usually go on sale often, its surprising to hear it did. __eou__ i know that is why i felt so bad __eou__ That is okay, maybe you will get lucky and win $200 one day to make up for it.
nice . i'm into true crime book . not much time to do anything else . __eou__ few years , play for baltimore orioles . __eou__ Oh thats nice. how long have you been doing that? __eou__ Since i can remember . I really enjoy it and I've learned a lot.  __eou__ thats very nice. do you like caramel cappuccino's? they are my favorite drink. Maybe we could get some sometime. __eou__ Those are really good.  Have you had the Creme Brule' ones with the crunchy caramel pieces on top from Starbucks? __eou__ I haven't. Are they any good? it sounds good. __eou__ It's probably my favorite one.  I like the crunch of the sugar.  I'm a texture person.  They should start having them around the holidays again. __eou__ Oh i like that. I'll have to try one when they are available. I doubt it will dethrone my favorite drink but I do like to try new things. __eou__ I totally get it.  I would never want to dethrone someone's favorite.  Haha!  So what do you for a living? __eou__ I work retail. Wish i could be reading for money instead, but it pays the bills. __eou__ I understand.  I bet you have some good stories to tell from your job.  __eou__ Oh yes. plenty. I read true crime because I can enjoy a satisfying true story but it doesn't remind me of work. __eou__ True crime is cool.  Sometimes it gets into my head a little too much.  I try not to let it scare me. __eou__ That is can be an issue. I try not to read only about homicides. it helps
my friend won a lot of money the other day which was cool for him __eou__ How did he win a lot of money? __eou__ He bought tickets to a fundraising raffle. I never have that kind of luck! __eou__ that's awesome! what was the charity? __eou__ It was a youth sports fundraiser.  __eou__ that's a good cause!  My friend and I played a gig recently in front of a group of people that were in a football team.   __eou__ You're in a band? How fun!  Do you play, sing or both?  __eou__ I wish I could sing!  If only!  I actually play the drums.  My bestfriend is on bass.  I love it! __eou__ The drums are awesome! You must be very talented. I cannot sing or play instruments. But I love music __eou__ Thanks for the compliment.  We play mostly 80's covers and a few originals.  I love music too!  Couldn't live without it. __eou__ How cool, love 80's music. I try to get my kids on board with it, but they don't see the appeal. 
i cant wait until next week! __eou__ What is going on next week? __eou__ I am going to start yoga __eou__ Yoga huh? What made you decide to start that? __eou__ I feel I need it bad they say its good for your health , have you ever done yoga before ? __eou__ Can't say I have __eou__ It is not going to be to costly and if I don't like it I won't go any more its a class __eou__ Well, nothing wrong with trying new things out. Don't really think its for me but you never know I guess __eou__ It might be something to look forward to and make new friends  __eou__ Hobbies are a great way to find friends no matter what they are I find __eou__ I tried boxing lessons one time and that was it one time lol __eou__ Boxing's pretty different from yoga, but we all gotta find what's right for us __eou__ I got sore and could not move the next day I hope yoga is not like that  __eou__ I've always heard you gotta fight through the soreness with anything new
just chilling . watching netflix . so what are you reading ? __eou__ i am actually rereading 1984 . you familiar ? anything good on netflix ? __eou__ i am not familiar with that what is it about? __eou__ It is about the people's struggle with never ending war, constant government surveillance, and public manipulation. __eou__ cool __eou__ It really is. It makes you think so much about police who persecute individualism and independent thinking. __eou__ i like more reading about fiction __eou__ Yes, I do also, there are good blogs where people share their opinions about books online. What fiction do you read? __eou__ like the laws of human nature __eou__ That is quite interesting. __eou__ it is, also like 20000 leagues under the sea __eou__ I have never heard of that. __eou__ it is really good you should look for it __eou__ thank you for the recommendation, I will!
I know. I think some of the stuff they are doing is really cool. __eou__ The Model S was the best selling electric car in 2015 and 2016, rather impressive! __eou__ I wish that I could make a car as cool as the Model S __eou__ I do too. What is your ultimate dream car? __eou__ Nothing too fancy. Just like a 2019 Honda Civic __eou__ Mine is a Jeep Wrangler. I like going off the beaten path and I want something that can handle it.

One of the saddest moments of my life was when my rabbit died. __eou__ I could not even imagine how you would have felt. __eou__ You sound like an animal lover too.  Any pets? __eou__ I do love animals. We currently have a dog and a cat. How about you? Did you ever get another rabbit? __eou__ Same on the dog and cat.  The dog was a stray named Blue.  The cat is a rescue named Smores. No more rabbits, for now. __eou__ We found our cat at the park one day, she was a skinny little kitten. She has been the best pet! __eou__ Awe!  I bet she is sweet.  What is her name?  What color is she? __eou__ She is black and her name is Moon. I never had a cat growing up but they really are so easy to care for. __eou__ Now Moon is the coolest name for a cat.  It's really unique, especially for this time of year. They are easy.   __eou__ No more pets for us for a while. We live on a lake so we get to see plenty of wild life around here, that's enough for me. __eou__ I bet it's beautiful.  I have always wanted to live on the water.  What area - if you don't mind me asking? __eou__ We live in the Midwest, it is beautiful here. I don't ever think about leaving. __eou__ I live in the Southeast.  I've come to appreciate it more the older I get.  __eou__ Lol- I appreciate so much more as I have gotten older. I enjoyed chatting
Really? what size? __eou__ I wear size 9 1/2-10 usually, we get discounts here in Beaverton Oregon because they are headquartered here __eou__ I wear size 8 1/2-10 usually, we get discounts here in Beaverton Oregon because they are headquartered here __eou__ That's really cool!  Sounds like they take care of their town. __eou__ Yes sure __eou__ Do you like Oregon?  I hear it's a beautiful place.
Do you have to be standing on the board while riding a wave to be considered surfing? __eou__ Not at all.  A lot of people prefer body boarding, which you can do by laying on the board or just dropping down to one knee __eou__ Have you been doing this a long time, you sound pretty educated on it. __eou__ Not really.  I just started doing it again this year.  I used to fish as a kid all the time. __eou__ I enjoy going fishing also, so peaceful. But gardening is my favorite hobby __eou__ Gardening can be considered relaxing, but it seems like you might be too relaxed it they plants are all dying! __eou__ I don't have a green thumb that's for sure, but I just enjoy it. Do you have any hobbies? __eou__ My favorite hobby besides gardening is horseback riding. __eou__ Horses are so beautiful, I haven't been around one since I was a kid. __eou__ Me as well and I really love the Blue Valentine and Hancock bred quarter horses. __eou__ I do not know much about them, wish I could be around them more. Would love to go riding again. __eou__ You should!  Maybe you could find a trail riding nearby or take lessons.  Horseback riding is good for the soul and balancing your body as well. __eou__ Sounds like a great plan, I need to look into it. Thanks for chatting! __eou__ Absolutely!  Loved chatting with you as well!  Have a blessed day.
i'd recommend it , do you have any other hobbies __eou__ well i love to cook , i am a vegan so i like to experiment with different dishes __eou__ oh that is cool, do you struggle finding things to eat? __eou__ Not like I used to, it seems society has become more aware and restaurants offer dishes. __eou__ that makes sense. i do hear about people making that choice more often. __eou__ yes, I think it is a much more sustainable way to eat. What do you like to eat? __eou__ pretty much anything! i am a carb fan. does not help out in swimsuit season though. i am so ready for snow. What about you? __eou__ Oh tell me about it, I love carbs - especially mashed potatoes. Do you like to skii? __eou__ i have never been snow skiing before! something i have wanted to try. have you been skiing before? __eou__ Only cross country skiing, I am too scared to try downhill.

Wow that is interesting.  Are they easy to grow? I would love to try. __eou__ Yes they really are. I actually have cinderblocks going around my garden area and they come out of the holes in them every year. Without having to replant.  __eou__ What agricultural zone do you live in? I'm afraid the frost would kill them in my area. __eou__ I live up north actually, so I am only able to garden in the summer months. Its a short season! __eou__ I live in the south, so if you have good luck growing strawberries up north, it sounds like I should have no problem. __eou__ It should be easy!  It grows quick and you can consume them in large quantities.  Strawberries are super delicious with chocolate. __eou__ That's a great idea! I think chocolate strawberries and a night on the beach are an example of a perfect day for me. __eou__ that sounds like a great combination . __eou__ What is your idea of a perfect day? __eou__ I like to kayak - so any day I can get out on the water is a perfect day to me! __eou__ Fishing from a kayak is one of my favorite things to do. Especially in the evening. __eou__ Do you own your own kayak or do you rent? __eou__ I found a good deal for a used one online. __eou__ That is awesome, its nice to own your own!

How about you? __eou__ yes. do you play any sports? __eou__ Just archery, i'm teaching my daughter some __eou__ that is so sweet! i bet she loves learning that. i love playing golf. __eou__ Golf!

My team mates have also become great friends.  My best friend, Calden has been there for me on and off the field. __eou__ awesome! i love having friends that you can count on __eou__ Yes, true friends can be like family.  Which helps when we have to travel so often. __eou__ that is right, do you travel a lot? __eou__ Yes, very often.  I play soccer professionally. __eou__ what is the place you have like the most __eou__ I have been the most impressed with Spain. __eou__ i have never been there i imagine is precious __eou__ Yes, the culture and the architecture are fascinating, however the people are the best.

It has been tough financially but overall better for my mental health I think. __eou__ Yes, the best is yet to come!  What are you looking to do now?  Travel? Hobbies? __eou__ I would like to travel as much as I am able. I finally have the time to go everywhere I have always dreamed of! __eou__ Where is the first place you are looking forward to going? __eou__ I would to start by traveling up the coast of California, maybe up to Washington, and then continuing traveling the United States. __eou__ Great plan!  I'm from the southeast and it's pretty here.  Always wanted to see more west. __eou__ I'm looking forward to seeing more of that part of the country. I bet it is very beautiful! __eou__ It is, especially with the leaves changing color right now.  I'm glad to see the colors.  They hadn't been as vibrant over the past few years. __eou__ That sounds very pretty, I bet the northeast has some vibrant colors right now too. __eou__ I'm sure.  I went to Boston and Salem in the Spring one year and it was beautiful.  Always wanted to go there around this time of year. __eou__ Oh, Salem and Boston are definitely on my bucket list. There's so much history there, did you visit any museums or anything while you were there? __eou__ The JFK Museum - which I guess is more of the Cape.  The Witches Museum.  Boston Harbor.

thanks i don't think i have had sushi before __eou__ try it some time you may like it . __eou__ What type should I start with? There are so many to choose from! __eou__ Well first you have to decide if you like brown or white rice or even just seaweed. __eou__ Hm, I've had seaweed salad before and enjoyed that! And I like white rice better than brown.  __eou__ The California roll is a great one for sushi! Classic! __eou__ I'll try that next tim! What other dinners would you suggest? I'll be at a sci-fi convention in the city and doing more dining out than normal. __eou__ Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska. __eou__ Awesome! I was surprised that they have a convention in Alaska. Are you planning on going? __eou__ I wish! I hear it will it be an interesting and fun experience! __eou__ I think so! I always like seeing the different co-players even though I'd never be brave enough to dress up! __eou__ You should most certainly give it a try when you go ! If I could go I would dress up as Jade from Mortal Kombat! lol __eou__ That'd be AWESOME! I think it's hilarious seeing some of the minor/obscure character cosplayers __eou__ Me too! I loooove playing Mortal Kombat.
I was walking out of the kitchen yesterday and I spilled my bowl of cereal all over myself. __eou__ Were able to save any of it __eou__ no, it made a horrible mess everywhere. __eou__ Yes i can now __eou__ you can now what? __eou__ Yes i involved __eou__ okay thats interested.

I was really scared about the possibility of losing my cat to a bad illness, but I was lucky that the vet worked hard to find out what was wrong. __eou__ Oh wow, I'm glad the vet was able to do that.

I actually just finished feeding her some treats. __eou__ Cats are great, I don't think I would have the time to look after a dog. __eou__ I want a dog one day. Do you have any other cats? __eou__ Nah, just the one. I spend to much time out of the house to have any more. __eou__ I would have 100 indoor cats if it were not for the smell  __eou__ At what point would you stop being able to remember their names? __eou__ I never thought of that but that is a great point.  __eou__ You would have to just number them, or give them all the same name. __eou__ Haha. What is your cat's name? __eou__ Tim. I like the idea of having a dog, but I leave too early in the morning for the gym, and get home way too late. It would be unfair.
I bet their burgers tasted way better back then. __eou__ I find it interesting they didn't always have the golden arches. The first was in 1953 in Phoenix, Arizona. __eou__ I din't know that __eou__ I was surprised that Ray Croc wasn't the person who started McDonald's originally.  He's just the one that bought it and started franchising and eventually made it famous. __eou__ Interesting. My favorite item is the chicken strips __eou__ Yes, they are good.  But I personally love when the McRib is back. __eou__ McRib is good too. Do you remember the big and tasty? __eou__ Yes, I almost forgot about it.  That was a good one.

That and a hot bowl of chili would make for a perfect night.  __eou__ You may want to try a video of a fireplace, playing on your TV, to make it feel that way.  The chili would be perfect! __eou__ That's a great idea! It's amazing what we can do with technology today. __eou__ Sometimes technology is a good thing - when it works right!

I read that scientists have developed a bacteria that eats plastic. Maybe it will help us clean up the oceans. __eou__ That would be really cool.

And the neighboorhood alerts are awesome __eou__ I love those videos where Ring doorbells capture people falling.  __eou__ I agree, and the ones where the delivery drivers throw temper tantrums.  __eou__ I havent seen those but they sound really funny.  __eou__ They get caught saying some pretty funny things, I wouldn't want to explain to my boss __eou__ yeah in this day you have to watch out for cameras everywhere __eou__ So true, it is a blessing and a curse.
I don't think my partner's been faithful to me lately. So I just took an HIV test. Waiting for the results has me so worried. __eou__ I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful? __eou__ I was an idiot and looked at her phone. I have trust issues and I was right.  __eou__ The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it. __eou__ I hope you are right! I'm still freaked a bit though.  __eou__ I would be too. You should talk to her about the cheating and also make her understand how worried you are __eou__ I don't know what to say to her. She has a way of making it all about me. Like I shouldn't have looked at her phone. __eou__ Well trust is earned. she shouldnt give you reason to doubt her __eou__ I thought I was being paranoid. I don't trust easily. This just screwed me up more. I will try man. Thanks __eou__ regardless of what she says about you checking phone, fact remains you were right and she cheated. you deserve better __eou__ Everyone tells me that. Maybe you all are right. Regardless of the test outcome. I need to take a good look at myself. __eou__ I agree, but worry about one thing at a time. get through the test results, then worry about you, then relationship, but concentrate on you first and foremost __eou__ Thanks for listening. I've got a lot to consider.  __eou__ Any time, Hopefully it all works out for the best.

I do agree! What is your favorite orange-flavored soft drink? __eou__ I like Sunkist Orange the best I think. I never knew they are called "soft" drinks because it's a contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks.  __eou__ Wow, what an interesting fact. I never considered that but it makes sense. __eou__ I love those weird types of facts. I usually drink soft drinks with caffeine, I have a Coke with me all the time. __eou__ Oh yes I love Dr. Pepper. Coke is a close second but I'll never drink Pepsi. __eou__ isn't it weird how people love either Coke or Pepsi? Not many people will admit to liking both. __eou__ I find the world to be a very divisive place these days. That analogy could be made about politics as well. We could all use more unity. __eou__ I agree, maybe Coke and Pepsi could be the start and call a truce in the cola wars, lol! __eou__ It would have an impact! lol Sony and Microsoft finally stopped bickering and started working together. __eou__ exactly that would be amazing, people need to be reminded that we are more alike than not __eou__ Very true. We all live on Earth, and we should all respect one another and the planet. __eou__ can I get an AMEN????  __eou__ Haha I'm happy you agree! Do you have any animals? I have a cat. __eou__ I have 4 cats, I am offically on the way to being the crazy cat lady.
everything ! i am actually manly . but i've a secret i am hiding . __eou__ what is your secret that you have __eou__ My parent's don't know that I am gay __eou__ Well parents aren't important. Just be true to yourself and live your true will.  __eou__ I'm not worried about what they will think just don't know how to tell them __eou__ Why do you even have to. It doesnt have to be your identity, its just a preference. I say just life your life, dont worry about it __eou__ I guess i'm just trying to figure out how to introduce them to my boyfriend. Family is very important to me and I want my boyfriend to feel welcome __eou__ Just tell them that you would like to invite your boyfriend over. Make no fuss about it and they shouldn't either. Maybe you can make dinner! __eou__ That would be a great idea __eou__ I'm a babysitter and I always love cooking for the kids. What will you make? __eou__ I'm not a great cook, but my boyfriend is. I think I'll have him help me. Do you have any suggestions? __eou__ That will be so fun. Make something that everyone will like to keep everyone happy. Maybe personal pizzas! __eou__ That sounds good! I love pizza __eou__ Pizza is awesome. You could have everyone make there own and have a few different sauces, cheeses and toppings!
The new movie theater is opening soon. __eou__ That sounds fun to go to. __eou__ Yeah I visit movie theaters sometimes when a movie takes my fancy __eou__ I enjoy going to the movies.  It's a lot easier than TV as I can only see 200 feet away. __eou__ That sounds like some weird eye sight problems. __eou__ Yeah, it is.  I'm hoping that surgery can help that.  What movie do you want to see when the theater opens? __eou__ I want to see the new Star wars movie. What about you? __eou__ Yes!  That's one of my favorite Christmas traditions for the past few years! __eou__ We have a Christmas tradition between me and my daughter she plants bulbs and seeds ready for the spring. __eou__ That sounds wonderful!  Definitely gives you something beautiful to look forward to! __eou__ For sure it does. I live in Florida so we can plant all year round. __eou__ I have family in Florida, I love all of the fruit trees.  The weather is wonderful! __eou__ Yeah it gets relatively cold during the winter for a month or two but usually great weather. __eou__ We try to go to St. Augustine at least once every couple of years.  That's where I would like to retire to one day. 
My daughter just turned 11 and for her birthday we are taking her to Universal Studios for the first time. She is finally tall enough to ride all the rides. __eou__ happy riding to your daughter __eou__ we cannot wait to see her reactions to the rides __eou__ What is her favorite ride shes hoping to ride? __eou__ She loves rollercoasters, I have been saving most my tips to afford the trip, the theme parks are so expensive __eou__ Yeah they're really expensive. __eou__ It is crazy what they charge. Do you have any trips planned? __eou__ i will be traveling to disney world like we do every year . __eou__ Oh wow, that is great you get to go every year.

I have seen videos of them eating dogs. Poor dogs.  __eou__ Yes, it's very sad. So many of them. __eou__ I wish we could have more reservations to keep wildlife safe and separate from human society. __eou__ I guess there need to be Exclusion laws. __eou__ What are those? __eou__ I have no idea but there are very few places in the world that have laws to restrict it.
I enjoy bagels too. How are they made? __eou__ It is shaped by hand in the form of a ring. Yeasted wheat dough is used, broiled and then baked __eou__ Very interesting, I love the taste, never attempted to make them __eou__ Do you think you will ever attempt to make them? __eou__ Not sure, its so easy to buy them lol  are they hard to make? __eou__ No, but they are a lot easier to buy.

Ah nice. Do you like to drink Budwieser? I think it's totally refreshing to have on a hot day like this. __eou__ Me too! I normally buy it in a 6 pack, but i love that they always have it on draft at my favorite bar! __eou__ Yeah, straight from the tap is the best way to get it!\ __eou__ Ahhh I'd have to say that I prefer the tap!

What are you going to spend it on? __eou__ a couple more tickets and maybe a drink __eou__ gotcha, I could go for a drink,but it cuts into my gym time. __eou__ gym time is always a good place to go. i could use some of that myself __eou__ Maybe you could cycle to work.  It is an efficient mode of transportation, so you can workout while also being productive, __eou__ if it wasnt so far then i might think about it __eou__ Well a lot of places in the world use bikes as the primary form of transportation.  I guess they save a lot on gas __eou__ that they do, and i bet a few many are in good shape for that __eou__ certainly, many do not even wear helmets, which does not help __eou__ well that is being reckless, you need a helmet no telling what could happen __eou__ i did not think of that lol , i guess your right __eou__ better safe than very sorry, alot of people can be reckless __eou__ this is very true , just gotta try to stay safe !
I am watching the last season of game of thrones __eou__ thats awesome. dont spoil anything, okay? :D __eou__ No way. Do you watch it very often? __eou__ I've actually been waiting to binge watch several at once. __eou__ That's the best way to watch a series.

Karate is good exercise. Have you ever tried it? __eou__ No, I haven't.  Do you practice karate?  It looks like fun.  __eou__ I am a black belt.

My sister just got a huge promotion and her husband bought her a new house. __eou__ Congrats.  They must be excited. __eou__ Oh yeah they are. Finally after years of hard work they have a place they own. __eou__ Ever thought about traveling to celebrate such occasion? Maybe you can join me to see the pyramids. __eou__ Seems like a strange thing to ask. But no, I personally cannot afford to go on big trips out of the country. __eou__ That's fair. How close are you with your sister? __eou__ Were pretty close, I talk to her a few times a month but she lives out of state so. __eou__ Oh. Perhaps you can go visit her and visit that new place.

We tried getting her help she won't open up. __eou__ That's too bad, has this been going for a while? __eou__ For a couple of months now. She doesn't want to be around. She used to love skateboarding with me it's our thing. __eou__ I am sorry! Maybe try to spend more time with her and get her involved in other activities? __eou__ Thank you I will try that. I just can't trust her with anything my husband wanted to remove her door. She hides things she takes in her closet. __eou__ She might grow out of it. How old is she again? __eou__ 12. Do you have kids? They are a handful. Most days I'm in jeans and a t-shirt because I'm so busy with them. __eou__ I do not have children yet haha I am quite young still __eou__ lol Okay yes take your time. What are you up to? __eou__ I am actually doing homework right now! What about you?
Someone stole my trash can. __eou__ Why on earth would someone do that? A totally pointless act! __eou__ I know. It was at the end of my driveway and now its gone! __eou__ Oh no. Did you report it missing? __eou__ No, there is nothing they will do about it. But I did mention it on our neighborhood FB page, seems I'm not the only victim. __eou__ You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you. __eou__ Really, you think I should. They will think I am crazy, it's just a trash can. __eou__ But it's stealing. You should install security cameras around your house. __eou__ We really do need cameras. I need to check into that ASAP. __eou__ I think it could help.  At least you could get an image of the perp. __eou__ So true. I deliver packages for a living so I see all kinds of security measures.  __eou__ I love our delivery guy.  I've been online shopping for more and more things lately. __eou__ Online shopping makes things so much easier and keeps us busy! __eou__ No joke! So many conveniences.
i do want to move to spain , study there and then teach english there afterwards though . __eou__ you do not have to move to spain , you can actually teach english virtually __eou__ Really? __eou__ Yes.

Which part of the world do you want to explore next? __eou__ Well, Spain for sure. Germany is a close second thoughg __eou__ Oh that's great. I wonder if that place is ashma friendly.

We have brown recluse spiders in the area where I live. They have a tiny shape like a fiddle on their backs. __eou__ Scarry. My friend is from tanzania, and they have big Baboon Spiders that can really hurt you. __eou__ I do remind myself of their good qualities. I like the fact that they eat other bugs, keeping them at bay. __eou__ I agree, they play a major role in the world keeping incects at bay. __eou__ It's pretty amazing the way nature functions. I am fascinated by all the creatures and beauty around us. __eou__ I am as well, but I will always still be nervous around the spiders tho. __eou__ Yes, they can stay in their homes and I'll stay in mine and watch them from afar. __eou__ I always try to save them when I can, but when they crawl on me I tend to hit them out of fear.
Can you tell me more about Italian's favorite dish? __eou__ Well, it can be topped with vegetables, meats, and condiments, and can be made without cheese! __eou__ Wow! That sounds so delicious  __eou__ Yes it is very tastey, I eat alot of pizza during work. __eou__ What type of pizza do you like the most? __eou__ I really enjoy deep dish, but normal pizza has its place. __eou__ It's been a while since I've had any pizza, but talking about it makes me want to order some! __eou__ Yes you should, Just the other day  me and my brothers ordered some for the game. __eou__ What game were you guys watching? __eou__ We were watching Worlds for League Of Legends video game, but both of them dont play as much. __eou__ That sounds like fun __eou__ It is fun and exciting to watch, especially if you play the game. You can learn alot from watching it. __eou__ When did you start playing League? __eou__ I started to play league back in season 4, but I am still sadly stuck in sliver 1. 
I have not however I've always been interested. The teacher to student ratio seems so beneficial for developing minds __eou__ Yes, it seems that on average homeschooled students score at least average on standardized tests and often above, so it may be quite beneficial if the parents have the time. __eou__ I agree. I chose to send my children to public school and I think they turned out all right. __eou__ When my kids were little we did it but we had a large house with a yard and would use the yard for their recess time P.E. __eou__ I admire people who choose to homeschool. I have two sisters who are teachers. I think the importance of teaching is underestimated. __eou__ I agree. We'll they're gone now and we recently lost our dog. I feel so incomplete. __eou__ Losing a pet is so hard. Our dogs have always been part of the family and we feel the loss almost as strongly as the loss of people. __eou__ So true pets are family. We still want them to be around no matter what. __eou__ I love both cats and dogs. Dogs are such faithful companions. __eou__ I agree. What's your favorite breed? __eou__ It's hard to choose. I think Blue Healers are neat dogs but I also love Italian Greyhounds and Poodles. __eou__ Nice, I love poodles they are so smart and easy to house break. __eou__ Yes they are very smart. Also, they don't shed which is a must for a house dog. Do you have a favorite breed? __eou__ I love poodles and Weiner dogs lol

I am typing almost 140 wpm __eou__ Well it is slow to my 170 wmp, it makes me feel like I am talking to a snail. __eou__ Sorry about that __eou__ Aplogy accepted, I went shopping the other day which I greatly enjoy. __eou__ Really? Where did you shop at? __eou__ I went to the pet store to by treats for my dog who is amazing as well. __eou__ Oh very cute __eou__ Do you have pets? __eou__ Yes I have a cat __eou__ I also enjoy cats, they are very independent. __eou__ this is true __eou__ What kind of cat do you have?
I enjoy bagels too. How are they made? __eou__ It is shaped by hand in the form of a ring. Yeasted wheat dough is used, broiled and then baked __eou__ I really love cream cheese on my bagels. __eou__ bagels are my secret actual favorite . do you work ? __eou__ Yes.  I work at a retirement community.  How about you? __eou__ worked long hours today , i cannot twirl any more dough tonight . __eou__ I know how long hours are.  Mondays are the worst! __eou__ I agree, I dislike Tuesdays because they are so far from Friday! __eou__ Tomorrow is Wednesday so we'll be getting closer to Friday then! __eou__ Well it's always right before Friday so that is always good! __eou__ Do you have plans for the weekend? __eou__ I haven't planned anything yet. What about you? How do you feel about Thursday, aka  __eou__ Thursdays are good.  This weekend I'll be packing to move. __eou__ That sounds like a great adventure, where you moving.
ahahah good lord that will be so sad . well nice talking to you . time is up __eou__ i love baseball . ok bye __eou__ glad to be talking again!  Caught some good deer today for dinner. __eou__ Did you really?  That is so great!  All I did was laundry!  Ha, ha. __eou__ You should try and get out more.  Laundry is overrated. __eou__ You're probably right, but I do go outside with my laundry! __eou__ That's good!  Environment friendly!  Or, are we talking laundromat?  __eou__ I suppose a little environmentally friendly; but more because I like to air dry them.  Much fresher! __eou__ That is the best way to do it, love the freshness myself.  Do you listen to music when you do laundry or other cleaning? __eou__ A little.  I more listen to music when I run and bike.  I try to be healthy.   __eou__ Those are healthy.  I've tried running but my knees don't do well. I love biking.  Is it pretty where you live? __eou__ Absolutely.  Just beautiful this time of year in the fall.  Leaves falling, etc.,   Snow is on the way too.   __eou__ Snow is so lovely.  I enjoyed snow when I lived in Alaska.  It was quite beautiful there! __eou__ I've never been to Alaska, but would love to go.  What did you like most about Alaska?
i see , you like gambling ? __eou__ i do not gamble its my job to help my clients win lots of money __eou__ How exactly do you do that? __eou__ I help my clients by providing detailed sports information to help their choice on who to bet on. __eou__ Oh, I see. So you must be good at remembering stats of players and teams.  __eou__ It is good to remember the good teams, but nothing beats doing research online. __eou__ Which sports do you focus on?  __eou__ I try to focus on football, but I also do baseball, bowling, and horse races. __eou__ Cool. I follow college football but don't gamble. It seems every time I do my team loses. __eou__ That seems to happen alot, with voting on your favorite team without looking at stats. __eou__ Do you rely solely on your research or does instinct come into play? What if you're making a recommendation to a client and your favorite team is involved? __eou__ I tend to follow research more, but sometimes you can get that gut feeling about a team. __eou__ Do you know how much a client is betting when you're making your recommendation? __eou__ Some times they tell me, and sometimes they do not. I tend to not want to know that information because that makes you feel more conntected if they loose it. __eou__ I can imagine. I'd probably not want to know--especially if they lost! __eou__ Yes it would make you feel very bad , and question yourself.
I feel alone tonight! It's hard to put your foot down and give tough love. __eou__ What happened __eou__ My son was misbehaving at the store. __eou__ what was the kid doing ? __eou__ He wanted me to open some candy up, I was buying it for Halloween. __eou__ Im pretty sure I did the same thing to my parent. Did he calm down?  __eou__ He did after a while but not before the whole store was staring at me.  It's necessary but it's so hard to give tough love __eou__ I dont have any kids, just my cat Charlie. __eou__ I love cats but we live in an apartment temporarily, my husband doesn't want any pets right now.   __eou__ Must be nice to have a family. My favorite food is pizza but having a family to cook for would be nice __eou__ The everyday hustle and bustle is hard with 2 kids, dinner, homework, bedtime and all the sorts.  Dinner is usually something easy during the week! __eou__ Sounds like quite the balancing act!  __eou__ It's hard to say the least, most days we're just in survival mode!  I do like to play tennis in my (very) spare time though!  __eou__ Ive never been good at tennis. Maybe I need a good teacher.
I think it would be a huge impact on our society just to find unicellular life __eou__ yes, that is true, and if much more advance life existed why haven't we hear more from them if they are capable of interstellar travel __eou__ It could be that they are afraid of us. __eou__ Or they have visited and the government is just covering it up.  __eou__ Or they visited, saw what our government is like, and turned right around and went back home. Lol. __eou__ Hahaha! You're probably not wrong about that!  __eou__ I'm not sure I would ever want to participate in space travel if it ever became an option to the general public. __eou__ I agree. Who would even have the money for that? __eou__ Yes, I'm sure it would be a bit pricier than the average plane ticket. __eou__ Yep, and think about how long it would take to travel anywhere.  __eou__ I guess we'll leave space travel to the astronauts and aliens. __eou__ I'll just stick to watching alien documentaries.  __eou__ Sounds like a good plan. And maybe an occasional flight across the country. __eou__ I hear Area 51 is nice this time of year lol.
I can not believe my friend died in a car accident last week. __eou__ Oh my god, Are you doing okay? What hapened? __eou__ I'm not sure. Her parents called said she was on her way back from a party with her boyfriend __eou__ That is awful.  I hope everyone is okay.  Do you know anything more? __eou__ Not really. No details have really been released but they don't suspect that drinking was involved. __eou__ I just hate to hear that about anyone.  Even worse had alcohol been involved.  I don't drink myself. __eou__ Yea I try to on social occasions. You know how college is, sometimes you have to tie one off just to get through the classes __eou__ Yea; I can understand.  College is actually where the stress led me to eat and live much healthier. __eou__ She was just in her fall semester classes for her Bachelor's. Such a waste.  I hear that they left a party in another city  __eou__ I hate to keep asking questions if you don't know, but did they total the car?  Do you know what happened to the other car? __eou__ Well I spoke to her dad. The car was totaled. No word on the other driver. It wasn't local to our county so not on our news. __eou__ Well, how are you doing?  I know this has to be tough on you - an emotional time for you. __eou__ Very much so. We've know eachother since 4th grade. I don't think the reality has set in yet  __eou__ I really hope family and friends will rally around to help.  I can't even imagine how difficult this is for you.
yea its so tasty with all the spices and stuff. __eou__ The herbs and spices are what make the food so damn good. __eou__ Food without having any added just tastes nasty to me, and disappoints me like my life sometimes. __eou__ I like lots of flavor too. I recently discovered Indian food and I love the spiciness of it.  __eou__ I couldn't eat spicy food, as that would tear my stomach up too much. __eou__ I just tried it recently and I love it! Certainly wouldnt give scaps to a pet though.  __eou__ Yes alot of herbs and spicys could make a pet very sick, reminds me that I wish I could be a animal sometimes. __eou__ What kind of animal would you like to be?  __eou__ Would be nice to live the life as a cat, as its very easy and worry free. __eou__ Yeah, my cat gets a pretty easy life. Im adopting a dog soon too. Love pets.  __eou__ What kind of dog are you looking to adopting? __eou__ Not sure but it will definately be from a shelter.  __eou__ Its always good to get a animal from a shelter, not good to support brining more new animals into the world full of homeless ones. __eou__ Absolutely! So many loving animals in the shelter. I would never go to a breeder. 
no , mostly weddings and events . __eou__ my best gift at my wedding was an outfit from donna karen . __eou__ That's cool.  I didn't get any gifts since mine was really low key. __eou__ Did you keep it low key for a reason?  Just cheaper to do it that way? __eou__ Cheaper. We were young and buying a house.. How about you? was it a big wedding? __eou__ It was a decent size.  Money is always an issue for a middle school teacher - ha ha.  But yea; fairly good size. __eou__ My middle son child will be in Middle School next year and he's about to drive me nuts with the attitude. You must be a patient person! __eou__ Music can tame the wild beast.  I love symphony orchestra music.  See if you can introduce some calm music into his life.   __eou__ That's a good idea. He is extremely smart, and his mouth is following suite. What subject do you teach? __eou__ Mathematics, and I love it.  Is you son into a particular subject that interests him?  Math?  Science? __eou__ He really excels in Math and Language Arts. The kid was reading chapter books in 1st grade. I loved math in school. __eou__ That is so awesome.  He must be a smart boy.  I think adding that orchestra music would be positive for him. __eou__ He's the kid that is good at everything he does and it drives my other 2 crazy. I loved filming and he is pretty good at that too. __eou__ Your kid should be on America's got Talent! unless you're not in america.
it is crazy . somehow i'm still overweight even though i run after them all day __eou__ it took me 2 years to lose any baby weight __eou__ I'm still working on it and my boy is 12. lol But I have found something that works for me now. __eou__ That's awesome to hear. Keep it up, it is an incredible work that I love always __eou__ I eat all the fruit and lo carb vegetables I want throughout the day and I have a small portion of meat with lunch. I'm losing 5 lbs a week. __eou__ It's a good diet. Please take some vitamins along with that. A good way to reduce fat is to walk or jog at least 30 minutes a day.  __eou__ I'm also doing battle rope workouts or Tae Kwan Do 6 days a week. How did you do it? __eou__ It's been a while since I done rope workouts. All I do everyday is jogging and warm ups. How things are going for you? __eou__ Pretty well. I'm from 217 to 179 so far.  __eou__ Wow! Congrats. How are managing your weight with your lifestyle? __eou__ Well, the martial arts helps a lot. My whole family does it now which makes it easier. __eou__ Well, that will really help you to maintain your health. How about your job? __eou__ I am mostly a self-employed handyman, but /i work some on the computer as well. __eou__ Sounds good. Glad to hear it. My work is really working well for me.
it's hard to believe the entire population of Iceland is under 400,000 __eou__ Yes, I think the reason is the temperature, but it is warmed by the Gulf stream __eou__ I love the cold weather, would move there in a heartbeat. __eou__ Oh, not me. I'd much rather live in a warmer climate, but it would be nice to visit once. __eou__ I wonder if there is n ice bar there? __eou__ There's gotta be. Gotta have a nice place to stay warm at drink at.  __eou__ Where would you live, if you could up and move? __eou__ South. Way south. Somewhere where is warm all the time, preferably by a beach. __eou__ That sounds nice, never been able to enjoy the salt life, really prefer doom and gloom.  __eou__ You sound like you'd be fun at parties lol. __eou__ Right! That's another reason I would love Iceland, less people. __eou__ You've got a point there. I would like dealing with less people too.  __eou__ That's a plus! Don't people say Iceland is green and Greenland is icy? __eou__ That's what I was always taught in school.
hi how are you i drive a volkswagen . __eou__ that is awesome . i don't like to cook . __eou__ I am starting to like cooking more. __eou__ I never liked it. I burn everything! __eou__ Do you like cold weather? I miss seeing snow. __eou__ I love cold weather but not keen on snow. Do you like to ski?  __eou__ I have never snow skiied, actually, but I love waterskiing. Would love to try it though! __eou__ My boyfriend lives in Italy during the winter months. He likes to ski. I dont though.  __eou__ Oh yeah? What does he do? I am a public affair liaison in my job. __eou__ He is an archaeologist. Does a lot of work in Rome.   __eou__ Oh wow, that sounds fun! Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom is my favorite movie of all time. __eou__ He wishes it was that exciting lol!  __eou__ At least he gets to visit nice places. I have not been to Europe yet but it's on mine and my wife's bucket lists. __eou__ Where in Europe would you like to go? __eou__ Lots of places, England, Germany, Switzerland. But we want to go to Iceland or Norway to see the Northern Lights first.
cool , i've a moped , its chill to drive __eou__ where are you from now ? __eou__ I'm from Texas. How about you? __eou__ i'm from mississippi . just moved back here from austin texas __eou__ Ahh! You must of seen moped's around Austin. I would imagine it would be an easy way to get around for college kids. __eou__ I remember seeing some on the street that just looked like motorized bikes. __eou__ My oldest son is in College and he wants an electric scooter to get to classes on the other side of campus. What made you leave Austin? __eou__ the shed . we had some leaks , and broken trees . half the town got torn apart . __eou__ Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. How is Mississippi treating you? __eou__ Pretty good so far. How about you? __eou__ I have only driven through Mississippi. Texas is typical bipolar weather Texas. It's in the 40's and raining. I was wearing shorts 3 days ago though __eou__ I always wear shorts everywhere. __eou__ haha... I have 3 boys and they seem to want to do the same thing. It was a fight this morning getting ready for school __eou__ that's nice. taking care of the boys must be a painful chore
My favorite Bruno Mars song is "Vercace on the floor",. __eou__ I think mine prob is just the way you are.  I think his stage name is cool but he is actually called peter gene hernandez. __eou__ Wait. Is that seriously his name? I thought it was legit Bruno Mars. __eou__ Lol, well isnt his BIRTH name but it was one his parents used a child for him. __eou__ Dang, you're right. I looked it up on Wikipedia. Didn't know that. Learn something new everyday I guess. Hah __eou__ lol TRUTH!, I think the MAIN buzz is the fact he Hispanice by origin, born in Hawaii and raised in LA. crazy childhood. __eou__ That's crazy for sure. It must be nice to be born in Hawaii though. Don't think I'd ever be able to leave.  __eou__ Oh you would. I was stationed there in the Navy. Keep in mind it keeps filling with people and there is nowhere for them to expand to. __eou__ I don't think that's so bad. Eventually the main island could be like a little Manhattan with an ocean side paradise surrounding it. Could be kinda cool. __eou__ Beautiful place for sure don't get me wrong. Fun fact did you know that Bruno got his start as a song writer?  __eou__ Makes sense. Most singers usually write their own stuff starting out. Usually it's not very good though, hence the switch to pros when they get bigger. __eou__ He had no backing and realized that he could get money ghost writing. 2010 he wrote a song for BOB and the lable wanted him to sing it __eou__ I remember that song. It came out when I was in middle school. Lol __eou__ "Nothin on You" was the jaaaaam. Lol I wish i had those skills frfr.
fry it in sesame oil and garlic . wow i had a wierd dream last night . __eou__ what was your dream ? ? ? __eou__ I was doing laundry, and did not even blink at the fact that I had some pink bubble wrap socks. __eou__ Did they pop everytime you walked? __eou__ Nope, not at all.  And there was a kangaroo that delivered pot directly to your house.  Company was BounceBouncePuff. __eou__ That is seriously funny!  No wonder why you remembered your dream!   __eou__ They're hilarious!  I should write a book.  Always looking to make the benjamins. __eou__ Definitely write a book!  I wish I could do something fun, but I have a mortgage now so I have to have a steady income.   __eou__ You can dictate it into your phone and type it up later, or hire someone to transcribe it. Folks make good money doing side jobs like that. __eou__ Very true!  You should start it tonight! __eou__ You should do it too.  What would you write about? __eou__ 100 reasons why I hate tofu sounds like a great title!  ha ha __eou__ LMAO absolutely!  It's like styrofoam.  Yuck. __eou__ Ewwww!  What's the nastiest thing you have seen people eat?
I went home for the summer and my mum cooked for me every day. __eou__ Oh! That's so nice isn't it? where were you coming home from? __eou__ Texas. Where are you from?  __eou__ Alabama, I have lived here my whole life. I have family in Texas and stayed there for a summer many years ago. __eou__ You know how hot summers are here then. Im just glad its getting close to Christmas. I love it! __eou__ Yes! Even hotter than here and Florida. I prefer cold weather, would love to move more north in the future. __eou__ My daughter loves the hot weather. Is it humid in Alabama? __eou__ Very humid. I loved going to Mount Rushmore and seeing how it was 97 but I barely broke a sweat. Dry heat was great. __eou__ I agree. Dry heat is much better than humidity. Not too humid in my part of the state though __eou__ That's good. The heat outside makes me glad that I work mostly from home lol. __eou__ Me too! I love a fire in my fireplace while I work. Cant beat it! __eou__ That makes me imagine a fire crackling. Very relaxing. Now I feel cozy and ready for bed. Where is the hot cocoa? __eou__ Im drinking some now as we speak! __eou__ Sounds like you have it made! A big bowl of chili would be good too. Have you ever been to a renaissance fair?
I just gotta sleep it off, it's not severe for me. __eou__ Okay that's good. The amount of dairy a person who is lactose intolerant can tolerate varies from person to person. So you're pretty lucky! __eou__ Working in a doctors office helps with getting the correct information for my intolerance __eou__ Yeah. We should not consume more lactose as it has adverse effects on our body.  __eou__ Definitely!  What do you use an alternative to lactose? __eou__ Well, I always consume milk products in alternative to lactose. That works good for me. __eou__ Lactose is the sugar component of milk.  You should try banana milk; it's not that bad! __eou__ Of course I will love to try that. But it costs more I guess. What about the other alternative? __eou__ They have all sorts.  Banana, rice, soy, oat, coconut, cashew, almond,  lactose free, etc.   __eou__ Sounds great. I will try these too. How are you managing your diets with all these stuffs? __eou__ Carefully.  It's very time consuming, but not feeling sick makes it all worth it in the end.  I need my health to continue school.  __eou__ Yeah, its very vital for us to continue our life with fit and healthy. I will let you know once I tried this stuffs. __eou__ Sounds great!  What do you do for a living? __eou__ I am an IT professional. At the end of the day, I get body pain and spinal cord pain. So, I need a healthy diet or plan.
i don't . i know . i just need to start again in a different country don't i __eou__ like they say , follow your heart ! __eou__ Who has that kind of money to just move to a different country thought? __eou__ If you work hard at you can someday. So just about anybody. __eou__ I'm gonna disagree. Its hard to get ahead, even when your work hard.  __eou__ I would forces on what you have in front of then when that finish you can did travel. it call saving up. __eou__ Maybe I'll just move to a remote area, build a small cabin and live off the land. __eou__ That's a nice thing to do. But it can be very pricey at the start tho. __eou__ That's true. Maybe I'll start out in a tent lol. __eou__ Just look for an old cabin for sell then fix it up. __eou__ That's a good idea. Fixing it up slowly wouldn't cost so much up front.  __eou__ Sounds good, you can start a green house/ garden to cut down the cost of food. __eou__ I do enjoy gardening. I think its fun.  __eou__ Me too. Then you can get a chicken or two.
My mom brought me my favorite salad and cheesecake yesterday.  __eou__ That sounds delicious! How nice of her! __eou__ Yes it was such a surprize when she walked in the door with the food, I had no clue she was buying food. __eou__ I LOVE cheesecake. A piece a cheesecake a good book and a glass of wine sounds like a relaxing evening. __eou__ My favorite cheese cake has to be reeses, I enjoy my peanut butter cups. __eou__  haha! Me too! I usually hide them from my kids so that I actually get some if I have them at the house. __eou__ Its always nice to sit back and gossip online with some peanut butter cups to be honest. __eou__ True Story! The ones with the reeces pieces are going to be the death of me. Im an RN so I know the way to the hospital. lol __eou__ Always suchs after eating a ton of them and getting the candy blues and feeling very bad. __eou__ Yeah.. I tend to eat them early in the day before I workout.  I don't feel as bad if I do that. What's your occupation? __eou__ I am a artist, so I have plenty of time to eat all th candy. The only down side, no woman seems to want to kiss a artist very sadly. __eou__ Haha! I don't know any artist so I don't know if I can agree. It must be nice making your own schedule. Not having to clock in seems less,stressful __eou__ Yes it can be nice sometimes, but suchs when you near the deadline. __eou__ Where do you live? 
i had a couple of cats as a kid , thought they might be like me __eou__ cat can be cute , again did you ask them if they wanted to ? __eou__ my parents love to teach, that's why they knew how to raise us when we were children __eou__ Teach as in there were proffessional educators or just that they raised you in a fashion that made every day a new lesson? __eou__ they were professional educators __eou__ NICE! I considered getting into that field of work. It has to be one of the few noble professions left in the world if you ask me. __eou__ May I ask what is your current field of work? __eou__ Well after college I ended up in food service and ended up staying. I am currently the GM of a Freddies Frozen Yogurt. __eou__ That's very nice. Do you enjoy that? __eou__ Not so much enjoy as it is very close to a 6 figure salary I suppose. My degree was in music and i broke my hand. Rendered it useless. __eou__ Thats unfortunate. __eou__ Very. Not much use for an artistan that can no longer display her craft. But the paper it provided my background helped. __eou__ which instruments did you enjoy playing? __eou__ Windwood family of instruments.
do you have any siblings ? __eou__ no , i grew up alone until i got my dog socks __eou__ I've got 3 sisters.  Adore them! __eou__ Sounds exciting.  I've heard girls fight over the bathroom time, with make up, hair, and all.  Was that an issue at your house? __eou__ It was a huge issue!  My oldest sister was the bathroom hog - she was always sitting on top of the sink and listening to the Beatles! __eou__ Did any of your sisters, or you, take dance lessons?  I'm studying to be a ballet dancer. __eou__ Ballet is such a beautiful form of dance.  I took ballet, tap and jazz.  I did best with jazz.  __eou__ That's great!  Jazz?  Is that like tap dancing?   __eou__ I think it went from jazz to modern dance by label.  I performed to Flashdance in my first show to give some context. __eou__ OMG what a great movie!  So many good dance routines and songs.  Wish movies were like that now.  Now it's all blood and gore. __eou__ I know exactly what you mean!  I'm a huge movie lover.  What are some of your favorite movies?
that sounds lame . listening to rap music always chills me out . __eou__ my favorite music is jacob sartorius __eou__ What genre is that? __eou__ Pop music. What do you like to do in your free time?  __eou__ I like to play on the computer and listen to rap.  What do you do? __eou__ I like cloud watching. Laying on the grass and just relaxing.  __eou__ That sounds great!  Do you pick out animal shapes in the clouds? __eou__ Sometimes. Objects other times. I like doing it at the park. Meet lots of nice people.  __eou__ That sounds really nice.  Maybe I ought to get out of my special chair and spend more time outside.  __eou__ It is nice. I prefer meeting people outside rather than a bar or club.  __eou__ At least you get to see them better outside! ha ha __eou__ Thats funny! Very true! __eou__ Do you have a favorite park? __eou__ Golden gate park in San francisco. You? 
so are you a smoker ? __eou__ no i am not . are you ? __eou__ Only occasionally, such as on my birthday, New Year's, or when taking a long drive that lasts several hours. __eou__ I understand.  I stay away from it completely since I love the hiking so much.   __eou__ I should stop also, before I develop health conditions like my dad did. I love hiking also! It is one of my favorite things to do with my friends. __eou__ Hiking is good for your soul too.  You get to enjoy nature. __eou__ Absolutely. I love anything nature, from watching the trees dance in the wind to the rush of water. So relaxing and peaceful. __eou__ I agree, the warm summer sun beaming down through the branches is such a wonderful feeling.  __eou__ Speaking of nature and long drives, me and several of my friends are driving north to see some fall foliage this weekend. We will also do some hiking and exploring! __eou__ Oh, than you might enjoy the Appalachian National Scenic Trail! __eou__ I've actually hiked part of that in the Smoky Mountains National Park! Hiking up to Clingmans Dome, the highest peak in Tennessee, was exhausting but unforgettable! __eou__ That's awesome.  I haven't done it yet, but would love too at some point.  __eou__ I recommend it for sure, especially this time of year. I wish I lived closer to it. Good thing I like long drives, heh. __eou__ Definitely a good thing.  I am a Colorado girl, so it would be a drive for me as well. 
I went to take the trash out last night and there was a stray dog in my driveway. __eou__ Oh no.  Was the dog friendly? __eou__ It was. I gave it some water and checked to see if it had a collar.  __eou__ That is nice of you... I have a pet dog and I would hope that someone would do that and call me. __eou__ It didn't have a collar though. I tried looking around for the owner today. 
that happens , but being content with what love they had left for you is good ? __eou__ i suppose . its why i am in therapy . depression is real . __eou__ It's difficult to cope with. __eou__ Yeah, it is some days are good but not all. sigh __eou__ It really helps to have a job you love, my mother was a teacher and even when she felt down she was happy to always teach. __eou__ That true. school just ways down on the mind to get the dream job. __eou__ My dream job has always been to be a nascar driver. The first car I drove was a stickshift, my parents were able to teach me. __eou__ That seem nice but I don't know to drove a stick-shift. __eou__ It is not too difficult! you can always learn! __eou__ Yeah but I don't know anyone with a stick-shift. __eou__ That is a problem, haha. Maybe your future car could be one! __eou__ lol. I can only dream. __eou__ So whats your dream job? __eou__ i just don't know anymore.
nice . what is your favorite color ? shades of green are the best to me . __eou__ mine is pink and married for alot of years __eou__ Still single.  Waiting for the right one. __eou__ You will fine the right one, you should try to do things such as local clubs, or even volunteer. __eou__ Working on it.  Tried online dating.  Big disappointment.  All looking for sugar daddy/mommy. __eou__ I wish you luck tho, its always enjoyable to spend time with someone youre close to. __eou__ Yes, it is wonderful.  Parents were married for 45 years. __eou__ That is a long time to be married, do they do anything special with each other? __eou__ Volunteer at the local hospital, bowling, even square dancing.  Mom stayed at home.  Dad worked for GE. __eou__ That is great, traveling is also another good thing to do with a loved one as well. __eou__ As a family we traveled from CA to NY.  Camping when we could, or staying with relatives along the way. __eou__ Seems nice to just jump and just travel with a "figure things as you go" type deal. __eou__ It was well planned.  Mom took care of that. __eou__ That is always good as well, always better to get cheaper prices on rooms if planned ahead.
i like the water and to paddle board __eou__ that sound so fun ! do you have a big family ? __eou__ Not really, me and two brothers __eou__ I have 6 brothers and 1 sister. Im the shy one.  __eou__ WOW, with that many brothers you guys HAVE to like water sports, and any other thing that is rough and tough lol __eou__ They do, Im kind of the odd ball. They like modern music, etc. I like the Beatles. They think Im weird __eou__ Lol as do my brothers. I'm an only girl to boot. Totally a mellinnial thing  __eou__ How many brothers do you have? __eou__ I have two. One older and one younger __eou__ Ah! Middle child! Im the youngest.  __eou__ LUCKY! My baby bro still at 27 gets away with MURDER with my mom lol. I still have being her only girl child leverage though. __eou__ I get away with stuff with my parents but my siblings call me out on everything! __eou__ I can imagine. But hey every age group within the family has their tactics to get one over on the folks. __eou__ I dont think I would like being the oldest. Paving the way for the rest. 
We're taking the kiddos to the amusement park this weekend __eou__ Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to? __eou__ Six Flaggs Fiesta Texas is such a blast!  It's a can't miss! __eou__ I have been! It is fun! It better now than it used to be my Twin, Jessica, and I thought it was boring when we were younger __eou__ They have the very best rollercoasters!  We ride those over and over.  This weekend is going to be Fright Fest which makes it extra fun! __eou__ I live in the DFW area so my oldest wants to go this weekend. My youngest son is blind though so I will need to find a sitter  __eou__ That will be nice.  The Dallas park is fun too.  I'm sorry your youngest can't go. __eou__ It will be okay. My oldest gets upset that there are things like this that we can't always do but he gets it. He's a good brother __eou__ Aww two brothers, that's sweet.  Sounds like they're close. __eou__ They are! How is the weather supposed to be this weekend? It's cold and raining here currently.  __eou__ It's about the same here in Austin.  I haven't checked the weather for the weekend.  Hope it doesn't rain!  Went from hot to not real fast. __eou__ haha! You can always count on Texas to be bipolar when it comes to the weather! __eou__ Ain't that the truth!  I lived in Alaska for a few years then came back to Texas.  It was just cold there!  Beautiful though! __eou__ At least you could count on it being cold! My closet is over flowing bc I can't put certain seasonal stuff up! I would love to visit Alaska __eou__ OMG, I know what you mean!  My closet is in sad shape. lol!  Have you seen any good movies lately?
Indeed it is. That why the President has such oversight of the organization and its budget. __eou__ i had no idea that eisenhower was the one who established it in 1958 __eou__ I never knew that either. I've never researched it that much. __eou__ that must be why i did not know ! __eou__ Do you think NASA astronauts have clapped some alien cheeks? __eou__ I believe the do. __eou__ I hope those suits of theirs offer lots of protection lol.  __eou__ I don't think so that where crabs come from __eou__ Lol, that makes a lot of sense. Not to mention the weird half alien looking people walking around.  __eou__ Yeah. They never walk straight when i see them. __eou__ Would you ever want to be an astronaut? __eou__ Honestly, I wouldn't mind it. LOL __eou__ I think I would go crazy with just eating space food and pooping in baggies.  __eou__ Lol. I think that's more hard work, but you'd only have to do it once lol
No, but I have always wanted to go. __eou__ Even though we have a huge population, we don't have a ton of land space, because of this New York is densely populated. __eou__ i love to to New York city __eou__ It's definitely a bucket list item.  If only to visit. __eou__ but once i should see it at any cost __eou__ Oh yes.  Living there for any amount of time is really, really expensive. __eou__ ya i know it, still i need to go tehre __eou__ Jump on a bus and go!  It's worth the traffic, the people, the high prices.  An experience like no other.  I moved here about 10 years ago. __eou__ ho okay, how about your life there? __eou__ Busy, hectic, loud, expensive.  But also exciting and happy.  Rent is atrocious. __eou__ sounds great.. i would like to taste it once __eou__ Yes, enjoy the taste of NYC culture.  And try the street food.  Nothing like it. __eou__ wow awesome i would love to come over here thanks __eou__ The street music is great, too.  Subway performers...amazing.
I'm actually attending law school to become an attorney. __eou__ Wow! That's awesome. Are you trying to get your Juris Doctor degree? __eou__ No I want to become a lawyer. __eou__ We have 3 lawyers in our family. __eou__ That cool. At if you get in trouble you can get some help. __eou__ No doubt.  My twin brother is a doctor.  Parents are very happy. __eou__ That nice. You like mysteries books. __eou__ Nah.  I'm more of a romance book nerd. __eou__ What your favorite book. __eou__ Anna Karenina.  You? __eou__ Eargon  __eou__ Think I've read that, many years ago.  Favorite movie? __eou__ howl moving castle  __eou__ Mine is Pride and Prejudice.  All versions.
Yes, I have! I love them. They look so luxurious!  Have you ever ridden in one? __eou__ I never have, but I am a car fanatic and have looked at famous models, especially the historic sports-racing Bentley 41/2 and Bentley Speed Six.  I have done a lot of research on the company and hope to one day own my dream car. __eou__ We rode in one once.  To a funeral.  High class.  Was afraid to touch anything. __eou__ That is what is keeping me from purchasing one. My dog is my #1 sidekick and he sheds so that is a problem. __eou__ Dogs are man's best friend lol.  We're going to the opera next week.  Madame Butterfly.  For the 15th time. __eou__ Wow you must really be fans.  Is it a dinner and date night? Any good restaurant suggestions that aren't vegan? __eou__ Yes, but just a quick trip.  We're flying into NYC, staying for about 3 days.  Then back home. __eou__ I visited NYC this summer.  I liked it! I like the business of it. __eou__ Busy place.  Need to set up reservations at good hotels to really experience the city.  Worth the money. __eou__ Absolutely! How long is that flight from where you are? __eou__ About 4 hours.  Driving is a nightmare. __eou__ I can imagine.. Probably about as bad as the drive from TX to California. That is brutal. __eou__ Sounds like it.  Bad things happening there right now.   __eou__ I feel like bad things are happening everywhere right now.  Makes you miss the days when things didn't seem so difficult. 
i draw first usually . then paint __eou__ do you like tea ? i like tea when i'm trying to be creative __eou__ tea in the afternoon is my favourite __eou__ I love tea after my dinner. Love coffee in the morning __eou__ how do you like your coffee? __eou__ Two Cream and two sugar. How about you? __eou__ half a teaspoon of sugar and no milk. What else do you like to drink? __eou__ I also enjoy drinking frappucinos. What about you? __eou__ smoothies with banana and honey. Do you like to eat healthy? __eou__ Smoothies are delicious and healthy. I am decent about my diet. Do you go to the gym? __eou__ I like to work out at home and go running in the park __eou__ A jog in the park is great to get some fresh air as well. Definitely better than the gym __eou__ And cheaper! Get some sun, pat some dogs, see nature. What more could you want? __eou__ haha definitely . only invention i need is more time in the day to paint __eou__ 6 chat turns finished! Well it was great to talk to you. Have a wonderful day __eou__ You as well. Have a great day.
very awesome . my husband and i want to travel after he retires next year . __eou__ where do you want to visit ? __eou__ Our main bucket list item is to see the Northern Lights and after that, perhaps the Maldives. And retire somewhere in the mountains so we see snow every year. __eou__ Wow, that sounds awesome. Typically people want to get away from the cold in retirement, and here you are chasing it down. __eou__ One of us is originally from the Philippines and the other from the Deep South in USA, so we are both tired of the hot and humid weather lol __eou__ Haha, makes sense. I play jazz piano in a band, I may need to add the Maldives as a potential tour stop and see what the hype is about! __eou__ It's a beautiful island nation for sure. Jazz would sound great there! I love taking walks and listening to jazz actually. __eou__ That's awesome, it definitely soothes the soul! Would you say that it's your favorite genre? __eou__ For relaxing it would be my favorite genre of music. Although what I listen to most in general is classic rock. __eou__ Very cool. You mentioned one of you are from the Philippines, are you still able to speak the native tongue?  __eou__ Definitely, especially from my region of the Philippines. What's challenging is understanding Alabamian accents here, hehe. __eou__ Oh, I bet. French and Arabic are my second and third languages, and I can understand those better than accents in the deep south haha. __eou__ I can imagine! Wow that is quite a broad array of languages. I bet Arabic was quite challenging to learn. __eou__ Most definitely, especially in regards to the written language, the characters are so much different than what we're accustomed to in the english language.
My cat just knocked over the trash and started digging in it. __eou__ I bet that made quite a mess __eou__ It was a huge mess. But I love her and forgive her when she misbehaves. __eou__ Animals are wonderful.  Most of the time. __eou__ Hah yes, most of the time. Do you have any pets? __eou__ 2 dogs, and 2 cats. __eou__ That is quite a family. What are their names? __eou__ Alpha, Beta, Cato, and Dude. __eou__ ABCD. What will another pet be named beginning with E? __eou__ thinking about a bird named echo.  but there's little time to train a bird, with all my school studies. __eou__ Echo is a good name. My cat is named Starscream __eou__ Nice.  What do you do for a living? __eou__ I paint houses. What do you do? __eou__ Real estate. __eou__ Maybe I've painted houses you __eou__ Could be.  Live in a small town in NC. __eou__ Small world. Well, it's been great. 6 chat turns fininshed! Good luck.
i work at sears __eou__ How do you like it?  Do you happen to work at one in Indiana?  The first Sears store ever built was in Evansville, Indiana.  I'm sure it was quite the affair at the time. __eou__ It pays the bills, ya know? It's just a part time gig for me, my main source of income is working as an insurance salesman. __eou__ They bought Sears for $11 BILLION... can you imagine?   __eou__ That's definitely insane, wouldn't have assumed it's value was anywhere near that. __eou__ Me either especially considering my pay for selling washers there ! lol __eou__ Haha, how do you like to de-stress after a long day of selling washers? __eou__ I like to unwind with music and a good book. You? __eou__ Pretty much the same for me, on the weekends I enjoy riding my bike through nature. __eou__ That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise especially when the weather is nice out! __eou__ Definitely, helps me clear my mind after a long week in the insurance business. What kind of music do you listen to to relax? __eou__ All kinds! I love trying out new bands.  __eou__ Same here, music is a huge passion of mine. I'm willing to give anything a shot at least once. __eou__ Nice. so do you see yourself selling insurance long term? What's your dream job?
I felt so bad when I got home from work because I saw a huge mustard stain on my shirt! __eou__ Aw that's the worst, especially when the clothes are new! __eou__ I agree. Do you know how to remove mustard stains? __eou__ Wash with cold water then use a white soap to wash it out in the sink. __eou__ Great! Thanks. Maybe I should stop eating food with mustard? __eou__ I would say same but I love mustard. __eou__ Me too. What other foods do you enjoy? __eou__ chicken __eou__ I love chicken! Especially on the holidays. __eou__ yeah, it the best with most things. __eou__ It adds so much flavor and is nutritious. Is chicken healthy to eat? __eou__ Some what  __eou__ I like to watch my weight, but it's hard. __eou__ i use the lose it app it very helpful. __eou__ Okay, thanks! I'll use the app too.
Yeah and farming is something that helps so many people. Without farms it would be extremely hard to survive. __eou__ Yeah, the majority of the food we consume comes from farming so without it we would go hungry. __eou__ For sure. I bet it gets hot in the summers working on farms though. I am not that fond of hot and humid temperatures. __eou__ Yeah, it definitely does. You get used to it though, I've been running my family farm since I graduated high school. __eou__ I bet that is an honor in itself! Do you listen to music while working? I like all music except country really. __eou__ Haha, yup I sure do. Country music seems to go hand in hand with the farming profession, so lots of that. __eou__ lol, I can imagine. I like some of the classic rock music that blends in some country like the Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd. __eou__ Big Skynyrd fan myself. I had a girlfreind who eloped with my best friend, "Freebird" was on repeat for awhile after that haha. __eou__ That's awesome. Sweet Home Alabama is pretty much a theme song for the area I live in! __eou__ Nice! The area being Alabama I assume? haha. __eou__ How'd you guess? lol. It's not a bad movie either I've been told. I'll have to watch it sometime. __eou__ Haven't seen it either. Do you watch a lot of movies? __eou__ Oh yeah, tons. My wife and I are both movie buffs. I enjoy nearly any genre of movies. We watch one we have not seen most days. __eou__ Awesome, do you have a favorite? __eou__ There are so many. I've called Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom my favorite for years. I also love The Cave. You?
In front of everyone my friend jumped off the lunch table and did a backflip. __eou__ That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare, or was he just feeling wild? __eou__ He is just crazy! I think someone dared him. __eou__ Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard! __eou__ It was at work at a family business. He probably will not be in trouble. __eou__ Oh, I thought it was at school.  How old was he? __eou__ I'm sorry, yes at school. Thanks for correcting me. He is 17. He should know better. __eou__ Yah, it's a wonder he wasn't hurt, or someone else hurt.  He should be a cheerleader! __eou__ I agree. There should be more male cheerleaders. __eou__ Where I went to school, we had a separate squad, of just male cheerleaders.  They used to do backflips every time the team scored. __eou__ That sounds great. A combined squad would be fantastic also. __eou__ Especially in the locker room!  LOL! __eou__ Maybe not that much mixing! __eou__ Hahaha! You're right!  Listen, I've gotta go.  It was good seeing you again.  
yep , i love to work on cars , airplanes , love to keep busy . __eou__ very nice , how much do you make a year ? __eou__ I freelance, so it varies quite a bit. On a good year I'm on the six figure fringe. __eou__ Wow, that's awesome. For my job, I help build cars. I love my job, but it only makes 30k per year. __eou__ Nothing wrong with that, the most important thing is whether or not it's something you're passionate about and enjoy doing. __eou__ That's true, for sure. I have met many people who made a lot that did not seem happy or who did not enjoy their jobs. __eou__ Yeah, freelancing suits me pretty well. I have a hard time sitting still so being able to bounce around and do whatever feels right is nice.  __eou__ I rather like having a predictable schedule but it is certainly not for everyone. What is your side gig? __eou__ I like finding old cars and restoring them and then selling them. Although sometimes I fall in love with the old junky ones and end up keeping them myself __eou__ That sounds similar to what my friend does flipping houses. He loves his job and it sounds like you do too! __eou__ Yeah, it's pretty rewarding and I really enjoy it. Have you ever considered a side gig? __eou__ I actually have a side gig where I go to various places taking pictures for a company and answer questions and they pay me. It's fun. __eou__ Wow, that sounds awesome. How long have you been doing that? __eou__ For almost two years now. It definitely helps me supplement my income and raise a family, and it's become a nice hobby in itself.
Parenting and child rearing is the same  __eou__ Yes it is, it is the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child. Unfortunately there are too many bad parents out there __eou__ i agree many parents do not have enough dicipline for their children __eou__ I never know who should discipline more, the parents or the school system. Maybe it really should be 50-50.  __eou__ not sure i would want the school system responsible for diciplining my kids __eou__ At the age, kids brains are sponges. They soak up everything they see and hear. They spend the majority of their childhood in schools.  __eou__ for the purposes of keeping order in the school i believe educators should dicipline children  but the fundamentals should be taught at home
wow . do you plan on keeping that farm in your family ? __eou__ i do its such a great lifestyle __eou__ Is it a good investment long term? __eou__ I really haven't thought of it as an investment.  It's more about a good place to raise my kids. __eou__ The kids could learn so much living on a farm. __eou__ I know I did.  And we had a lot of fun, too. __eou__ How many generations has the farm been in your family? __eou__ I'm the third.  My grandparents bought the place, then my dad took over, now it's up to me. __eou__ I think you'll do great! It's a wise decision to keep the farm. __eou__ Just talking about it reminds me of all the good times we had, like swimming in the pond, doing hayrides, so much fun. __eou__ I wish I could have grown up on a farm. __eou__ Well, it's a lot of work, too.  Between the animals, baling hay, the garden.  But there were probably good times where you lived, too, right? __eou__ Yes, I enjoyed riding my bike around the neighborhood with the other kids. __eou__ Did you have a lot of friends in the neighborhood? __eou__ Yes, all the kids hung out together __eou__ That would be nice.  I used to stay over with my friends in town some time, go to the movies or whatever.
I like it too. But i am wondering where it originated from __eou__ The norms of the tradition were codified between 1550 and 1900, also known as the common-practice period. __eou__ Interesting, do you have a favorite composer? __eou__ I love lots of classical music artists of course, but my favorite has to be none other than Beethoven! __eou__ Can't go wrong with that. Some of my fondest memories were traveling with my dad and grandpa in the circus and them introducing me to Beethoven. __eou__ We have that in common then. I can't say the same for my wife and three kids. They get tired of hearing me play classical lol. __eou__ Haha, I only live with my two golden retrievers, so they don't have much say in the matter. __eou__ Ah, I love dogs. Used to have a golden retriever. Now we have a miniature dachshund. If they howl at the music, they like it! __eou__ Haha, if that's the case then I guess a dogs favorite genre is "emergency vehicle sirens" __eou__ lol, maybe so. My dog seems to love the sound of a loud nearby train on that note. __eou__ I'm pretty fond of trains myself, I traveled on them with my family circus growing up. __eou__ I've only traveled by train once for an hour. My family wants to take a train vacation that goes across several states one day. __eou__ That sounds amazing, you get to see a lot of beautiful landscapes when traveling by train you don't get to enjoy via air travel.  __eou__ No doubt. I bet it is a lot easier to sleep and relax on a train than it is compared to a plane also. And cheaper.
oh no , i'd not eat it if it was . yuck ! ! __eou__ yeah i am really allergic to shellfish . __eou__ ouch i would have a hard time if i had to cut shellfish out of my diet __eou__ It's just as well.  I can't really afford them anyway. __eou__ it is expensive i try not to splurge too often __eou__ I'm saving my money to buy a new pair of shoes. __eou__ i spend alot on shoes i play tennis alot __eou__ Have you been playing for a long time? __eou__ not very long about a year __eou__ How did you get started?  I think that would be great exercise. __eou__ my apartment complex has a tennis court and a few of my neighbors play __eou__ That sounds like fun.  Hey, do you know anyone who'd like a cat?  I've discovered I'm allergic to cats, too, and need to find mine a new home. __eou__ not really id love one but my apartment doesnt allow them __eou__ That's too bad.  I really love cats, they have so much personality.
oh nice ! my mom went to beauty school too __eou__ oh awesome ! well you guys are all set ! are you married ? __eou__ no were not married __eou__ Working as a stylist in my own salon, I meet plenty of interesting people from all walks of life, to say the least. __eou__ i bet you do i take my mom to the salon once a month __eou__ That is a good way to bond. What do you do for work if you don't mind my asking. __eou__ im in healthcare i work in a pharmacy __eou__ Healthcare is always a great field. My mom is a nurse and loves it so much she's not sure she will ever retire. __eou__ it definately has good job security especially nurses __eou__ Yeah for sure, and it pays well also. Our jobs are similar in that we get to help people and do a service for a living. __eou__ dfinately my mom and i both like the aspect of helping people it makes the job worth it __eou__ My husband is in the healthcare industry also. He works in disease control for the government. __eou__ wow i just fill prescriptions his sounds a bit more advanced then mine __eou__ It's a multifaceted job. He makes home visits and drives a lot en route to saving lives. It gives him pride, his job.
well there's shrimp gumbo , shrimp cresol , ship scampi __eou__ oh yeah shrimp is like the shrimp of the shrimp __eou__ Haha, that's definitely one way of putting it. As a classically trained chef, I really enjoy working with shrimp. __eou__ Since I cut out meat, I really miss shrimp. __eou__ Cut out meat? Did you do it for health or ethical reasons? __eou__ A little bit of both.  I really needed to cut down on red meat especially, and I was reading about all the water it takes to raise meat. __eou__ I've heard that as well. I try not to think about it, I have male pattern baldness and the stress of things I have little control over don't help! __eou__ Male pattern baldness?  What's that? __eou__ It's basically the way a male loses hair, you start losing hair at the hairline and it keeps going up from there. __eou__ I've noticed my hair is getting thinner lately.  Never used to be a problem.  Comes with age, I guess. __eou__ Yup, no sense in worrying about it. Eventually i just plan on shaving it all off, at some point it's more trouble than it's worth. __eou__ That's not fair!  Women can't do that.  I'd have to buy a wig. __eou__ That's okay, I hear the quality of wigs are great these days. Getting ready in the mornings would be pretty quick too. __eou__ LOL!  So, are you going to the concert this weekend?
Scarlett O'Hara uses the title phrase when she wonders to herself if her home on a plantation called "Tara" is still standing, or if it had "gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia." In a general sense, the title is a metaphor for the demise of a way of life in the South prior to the Civil War __eou__ Is Scarlett O'Hara the actresses's name or the character's name? __eou__ The character's name. I cry every time I watch that movie. It's so timeless. __eou__ so is it a sad movie ? __eou__ In a way yes, it's very dramatic and it builds up throughout the movie. And the ending, wow. __eou__ ive never actually seen the whole thing i remember it playing on tv alot when i was a kid __eou__ I never saw it until four years ago but it was worth the wait! Another hobby of mine is playing around with clay models. __eou__ thats cool i play guitar what do you do with the models __eou__ Oh yeah? What kind of guitar do you like playing the most? I mostly like making pottery and using it around the house. __eou__ i used to be in a metal band but i play all sorts of styles now __eou__ That sounds awesome. I love listening to classic rock the most and a lot of that is hair metal. __eou__ we were more along the lines of thrash but hair metal ids definately a part of it __eou__ Sounds cool. If I were to try out playing guitar I'd like to play electric first. But for now it's just air guitar. __eou__ i takes about 2 to 3 years to get decent at it

My whole family drives Chevies. __eou__ I like Fords, as long as they're blue.

The other one is not memorable and I really liked the cast they choose. Did you like the live action movies? __eou__ Yeah, I thought they were good, I guess they did the live actions before Disney, interesting __eou__ Really, I didn't know that. Disney owns all of Marvel now as well. They are buying up everything.  __eou__ It seems like it, I think it's too much __eou__ I do too. I was upset when all of Jessica Jones, Punisher and Daredevil was canceled because Disney bought them out. Netflix had to end the shows.  __eou__ Man, that's terrible!
Yes, and soccer has been part of the Olympics (men) since 1900 and womens since 1996. __eou__ The most exciting part of this is that people love the game all over the world with a record number of 250 million in over 200 countries __eou__ It is a sport that is always growing, I like it so much, Go Manchester United! __eou__ I love Manchester United. __eou__ Arent they just so fun to watch?

I had a friend who was an only child and he was very shy and kept to himself a lot. Are there any advantages to being an only child? __eou__ I mean I guess they get a lot of attention from their parents. The term only applies to people that never had a sibling. __eou__ I am an only child too, it's lonely not having siblings __eou__ I could see where that would be a problem. It was always lonely though not having anyone to grow up with in the same household. __eou__ I get what you mean, I wish I had siblings too __eou__ What do you like to do for fun? __eou__ I like to watch TV, sounds kinda boring, but there's so many great shows __eou__ What are your favorite shows? __eou__ Supernatural is one of my faves, then I like historical shows and detective shows, you? __eou__ I like comedy shows like Impractical Jokers. __eou__ Oh yeah, those are fun to watch sometimes, do you like reality TV then? __eou__ Not really, but i have watched older episodes to release my stress from watching Judge Judy, a reality court show __eou__ I like her, I don't watch her much now, but she's pretty great __eou__ I think some of the episodes may be made-up, but it is still entertaining! __eou__ I think so too haha

They give sad lessons on death. __eou__ That is very true.  I like fish in the ocean, mainly dolphins __eou__ The joy of catching sunfish is giving them a chance to be out of the ocean. In direct sunlight. __eou__ Exactly! I don't like people who fish and keep them to eat.  They belong in the ocean! __eou__ Then we must disagree, for I am a proud fisherman who loves nets and hooks. __eou__ Do you like to catch crabs as well? __eou__ Crabs grab onto lines and nets by themselves, and no effort is needed to catch them.

Around the world treatment still varies and can be severe. __eou__ Very interesting, I'm glad I live where I do.  __eou__ It happened long time ago in India.

It's something I've been interested in on occasion. The name is kind of strange though.  __eou__ Although some consider it to be religious apparently those involved prefer to think of it as spiritual or mind spirit and Body __eou__ How do people find it religious?  __eou__ It's an object that you attach meaning to and believe it will help you in life.

They are so neat! __eou__ Yes, they're wonderful. Was that your job?
That's great! Life is a lot less stressful that way. __eou__ In some societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education. That is crazy to me. __eou__ It makes sense, most make a decision at a young age that affects them for a large part of their lives. __eou__ I believe it is the toughest and most important decision to make. __eou__ There should be more guidance on the matter of choosing a career. I thought my decision was going to be irreversible.  __eou__ there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions. __eou__ I disagree. Not everyone can be what they wish. Sometimes you have to follow your head, and even that doesn't always work out.  __eou__ I see your point.  It is a good one! __eou__ I myself changed the direction of my education multiple times. There were benefits but ultimately it was a mistake.  __eou__ I believe that.  I also changed directions and it put me behind many years. __eou__ It is comforting that others have similar issues. But this is why I mentioned there should be greater guidance during the early years of picking a career path. __eou__ Exactly it is such a crucial decision __eou__ I have noticed that there has been greater focus on guidance for younger generations. My generation was less fortunate. __eou__ True, I agree with you.  It does seem like that!
I am excited for baseball playoffs. Are you? __eou__ I watch it sometimes, It can be a little slow moving for my taste. __eou__ It's slow but you have to savour it like a fancy meal.  __eou__ I love when it's a tie and goes into extra innings to break it. It really gets exciting then. __eou__ Definitely is and for me personally I sometimes don't want the game to end. Do you support a team? __eou__ I like the Astros! I watched the game tonight after I got out of taking beauty classes. __eou__ I love the Yankees. I word for an advertising company doing commercials for a living. How much longer do you have before you finish your classes>  __eou__ How fun!

I tend to watch motivational videos as I lost my father when I was in high school and it still affects me to this day. __eou__ next to losing a child , losing parents is the hardest thing a person can go through __eou__ It was tough as he wasn't that old and he was my best friend. Have you lost anyone close to you? __eou__ Not currently. My most recent passed away a couple of years ago and I haven't been ready for a new one.

I hope he made it perfect for you. __eou__ He did. He was nervous but gave this romantic speech about how I was the one and then got on one knee and I started crying. __eou__ That is very sweet. Will you have alcohol at your wedding? I've never had any. __eou__ I dont know yet. I havent started planning but I am putting together an pintrest page on what I want.  __eou__ Good idea. I love Pintrest. If I were getting married I'd love to bring my dog, she is my best friend! __eou__ He has this cute dog and we are thinking of making him the ring bearer.

I love a good melt in your mouth steak. __eou__ I just wanted to be healthier, so I started with veganism which is the practice of abstaining from animal products. __eou__ Well, actually my husband wanted me to eat healthier, even though I think steak is healthy. __eou__ We eat steak at least once a week, but I know it isn't necessarily healthy. __eou__ It is filled with protein, so I believe it is good for you if you eat it once a week.  __eou__ Yes, but I know a vegetarian diet is so much better, the problem I would have is I don't like vegetables. __eou__ I love vegetables, they are great in salads or eaten as a side dish.  __eou__ I like salads, which is probably the only vegetables I really like.  But, I think the protein from meat is important too. __eou__ Yes, protein is very important for your health, and for building lean body mass.  __eou__ I live in the south where everything is fried!  At least I do grill almost all the meat I eat, including the steak.   __eou__ Fried food is not good for you. Grilling is a good way to go when cooking meat. Beans and yogurt are also a good source of protein. __eou__ Yogurt is okay, but I don't think I could eat enough beans to make up for the loss of proteins.  Have a good day! __eou__ You too, nice talking with you.  __eou__ How do you finish this task, I am only showing a return button.  I thought I just clicked done.

I can't imagine what its like to be a part of all that. __eou__ We had a Gale that blew through yesterday, neighbor came by to check on me and he heard a Mall was going in! __eou__ Oh wow! A mall, I wonder how that will go over? __eou__ Well, what I want to say I won't! But, either way, they won't break ground til Spring. __eou__ Well that will be here before we know it!! __eou__ I hope so, I really dislike the cold of winter!

I had too much fun while my kids were gone and I want them to stay away for another day. __eou__ Nothing wrong with that. __eou__ WHen they come back I am refreshed and ready to enjoy them again. __eou__ Everyone needs to recharge every once in a while.

There is always something to do. __eou__ Love the idea of farming and living in the country. Best of luck to you in that endeavor.  __eou__ I love the country.

Did you do any work from home. __eou__ Yes, actually all I do is work from home. I have lots of different sources of income like online stores to crowdsourcing sites.  __eou__ Can you suggest some just for information __eou__ I would sell used items on mercari and then if you make something I would open an etsy store or also list on mercari __eou__ Its a new thing for me. Do you have some freelancing sites? __eou__ I have never had much luck with freelancing sites.  __eou__ Oh, have you ever tried Fiverr or Upwork etc. __eou__ I have an upwork but I have never landed a job yet.

Do you enjoy being out in nature while you are walking? __eou__ I do, but it raises different problems than that in water, I get tired very easily! __eou__ I love walking in nature. I wish I had more time to devote to doing it. __eou__ It is hard to motivate myself if it wasn't for the scenery probably. __eou__ I love walking in the Autumn it is so crisp and beautiful. You also meet lots of interesting people.  __eou__ yep nature is pretty awesome . the complexity of everything can humble a person . __eou__ I try to walk ten thousand steps each day.

I hate trying to apply for jobs, putting so much effort into it, and then not getting any sort of response back. It's like, yeah, okay, I understand if you can't hire me, but can you at least tell me that you're denying me, and maybe why, too? __eou__ I think we're just another number for them. __eou__ Cycle of life. But it would just be helpful. Therefore, I wouldn't be sitting around waiting, hoping, expecting. __eou__ It would be helpful. How hard is it for them to make a personal message you know. We took the time to fill out the application you know.  __eou__ Exactly!

Read any good books? __eou__ I enjoy drawing and I havent found any good books lately but I am into Gillian Flynn and love her writing.  __eou__ Wow-Flynn! She's published three novels, Sharp Objects, Dark Places, and Gone Girl, all three of which have been adapted for film or television __eou__ Yes, which I have seen and read all those. I think the tv shows and movies do justice to the books. 
i just made a steam boil man is it good love seafood __eou__ i wish i could eat fish . had to call 911 last time because it gives me migraines . __eou__ Thats too bad, shellfish is great! __eou__ I agree, it never use to bother me, but suddenly every time I ate shellfish I'd have a migraine. __eou__ You might want to see a doctor and try and narrow down what your triggers are. __eou__ I did, the doctor said chasing the causes of migraines is like trying to catch the wind.  So many factors are at play. __eou__ Yes, I can see that, there are a lot of foods. I love iced coffee, how are you with that? __eou__ Oh, now that is one of my favorites.

He is 6'5" and has a nice spin on his pass! __eou__ Best of luck to him, maybe he'll end up playing for a great school like Alabama! Roll tide! __eou__ He would love that! Believe me...his Super Heroes are Rodgers and Brady, and right now he's just a Sophomore but playing Varsity...so who knows! __eou__ Varsity as a sophomore is fantastic! Did you used to play any sports yourself? __eou__ No, I was more of an art person, That's why I collect seashells, I make custom lampshades for clients. __eou__ Wow those sound neat!

I don't know much about gun laws. I live in Texas, so there are a lot of people with firearms. Do the laws vary by state? __eou__ Yes they do vary by the state you live in it is defines by 2 groups gun control and gun rights. I feel like in my state the laws need to be much stricter on guns. __eou__ Texas is very liberal about open carry law. But I'd rather know if someone has and weapon and can see. Those people aren't the worry. __eou__ Texas is a great place! I can understand the need to want to be prepared especially in the world today. It's hard to feel safe out in public. __eou__ I have a gun collection too, but am mindful and always lock them up properly in a heavy safe. But, I have them if I need them.

I don't think I know it.  __eou__ I'm a drummer, so I also like a lot of the Who and Zeppelin. __eou__ Yes, they were good bands and a good time for music. Actually my kids appreciate their music also.
The lady accused me of being at fault for not honking my horn! __eou__ Oh no, was anoyone hurt? __eou__ No, thankfully not. It turned out OK. __eou__ I'm glad no one was hurt, I hope the repairs weren't too expensive __eou__ No, they weren't and I must say I am also glad the woman was OK. I understand her concern. __eou__ I'm glad she was okay too. Maybe in the future she will pay more attention before backing out. __eou__ Yes, I hope everyone learned something. It won't stop me from continuing to bike, as I do love it so. __eou__ Was her car red by any chance? That's my favorite color. I want a red car. __eou__ No, it was blue, but my bike is red. I love red also and once owned a red car, so I know you'd love one. __eou__ Awesome! My car right now is gray but I should have picked out a red one instead. Maybe in the future I will look for a red one. __eou__ Oh, yes, you'll have another chance to get a red car. That'd be great! __eou__ One of my siblings think red cars are the best so she's probably right, we both have the same favorite color __eou__ Ah, is that a brother or sister? I have one younger brother and one older sister. __eou__ I have two siblings as well. The one that likes red cars is my older brother.
This past month, due to my consistent exercising i gained 8 pounds of muscle mass with the help of Whey protein powder. I am so proud for my accomplishment __eou__ That's wonderful! Congratulations! What kind of program did you do? __eou__ I didn't do any specific program, I just paid a little extra on my membership to get a personal trainer! __eou__ Nice, what made you decide to get a trainer as opposed to finding a program yourself? __eou__ Having a trainer made me stay consistent and kept pushing me even when I wanted to quit. __eou__ That makes sense. Do you have any pets? __eou__ I have a dog. I want to get another so he's not so lonely. Do you have pets? __eou__ Yes, I'm a big fan of lizards so I own a few of those. What kind of dog do you own? __eou__ I have a German Shepherd, he's still a puppy. I got him for my girlfriend a few months ago, but she tells me she doesn't want him anymore. __eou__ That's too bad, I've always loved german shepherds, they're very smart. __eou__ He's already so smart! She tells me she's leaving me. I'd choose my dog and guitar over her any day! __eou__ Haha, I hear that. I'm big into my guitar as well, I've always been the guy with long hair and a rebellious rock attitude. __eou__ I was always the guy in school carrying his guitar on his back. I play really good, I'd like to find someone to do vocals over my playing one day __eou__ Do you play acoustic or electric?
thank you for your kindness __eou__ i jut adore kind people __eou__ Its so rare here in NYC for people to hold doors! Ive been here a month I'm a freshman at NYU __eou__ Do you like it there how has it been for you so far? __eou__ Its great, just adjusting to city life. My three older sisters went here too, Im the youngest...they set the tradition! lol __eou__ That is awesome I have never been what is your favorite thing about it? __eou__ It's true what they say, it's a city that never sleeps. The art, culture and of course 24/7 FOOD! Such great Italian near by! __eou__ What is the best restaurant there. I love pizza and have always heard it was good. __eou__ I personally love John's of Bleeker Street. It's just delicious and I love anchovies!! I know, I know...gross right? lol __eou__ That is gross I couldn't imagine eating that at all let alone on a pizza! __eou__ Well, albeit, they are slimy and microboned, they just add an incredibly salty little zip on top of those cured meats, sauce and cheese...YUM! What Pizza do you like best? __eou__ I like the chicago style stuffed from papa murphys it has all the good stuff! __eou__ Ah...the former debate...thick vs thin....but then again the Potato Pizza in Rome as in Italy is to die for!! __eou__ The description alone makes me want to get on a plane to Rome.
My dad's wife asked me to give her back the glassware she gave us at our wedding. __eou__ That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back? __eou__ She found out that it has increased a lot in value and wants to sell it. She is very greedy. __eou__ Yeah, she sounds terrible. You shouldn't give it back. __eou__ I may give it back so that there isn't drama in the family. __eou__ You should sell it yourself, take the profit and tell her you don't have it anymore. __eou__ I should but I don't want that side of the family to be mad at me. Me and my grandma make pizza together often.
I like Apple and the girlfriend uses Andriod we are a house divided  __eou__ Haha.. understandable. The Pixel brand hasn't been around for as long as they have, since it was just introduced on October 4th of 2016, but if you like cameras, this thing is worth it. Google has placed an emphasis on the camera, and it's ranked as the best camera on DxOMarkMobile, with 89 points, before HTC released their U11 model. __eou__ Ill never deviate from my Apple, I love it as much as I love summer and mexican food! Ole! __eou__ I always need my cell phone I have to use it for work apple is a good product as well.  __eou__ I have all Apple everything, so it's convenient.  Just need to convert my girl...for her its like a new religion __eou__ Yeah it is really hard to get people away from what they are used to using that is for sure. __eou__ It's crazy though, with the technology, that people actually even buy cameras any more...has to be a dying business...dead! __eou__ I have not seen an actual digital camera in ages I just always use my phone. __eou__ Me as well, I only worry about the big brother thing lol ...you know they're watching this conversation now lol __eou__ oh yeah they always are if they get into my phone all they will see is puppy pictures haha. __eou__ hahaha!!! my girl too constantly taking pics of the dog in clothes ...its her baby __eou__ I have two Australian Shepard's and they are pretty much my life.  __eou__ Beautiful dogs! She has a shrimpy little Brussel Griffon, the little thing is pretty funny I gotta say! She's a little boss! __eou__ They all have such a cool personality that is for sure.
I trust my family, they have never let me down __eou__ Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that. __eou__ I find I need my family more now that I'm out of school. __eou__ do you have a large or small family? __eou__ 2 brothers, 3 sisters __eou__ Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if they get along. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well. __eou__ I love them all. I'm the baby. __eou__ It's awesome to have so many siblings, do they all live close to you? __eou__ They're all on the West Coast, which is horrible. I'm on the East. __eou__ That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon! __eou__ It's too fake out there. And I have my own kids, now. __eou__ that's unfortunate that they are so far, do you do family reunions yearly? __eou__ Every Christmas is a reunion at my folks' in New England. Do you see your family often? __eou__ I live very close to family, so I see them a lot.
I was in an antique store and found a really old coin for cheap. It was real and its very valuable. I'm so happy! __eou__ thats awesome! __eou__ Do you collect anything? __eou__ no i don't collect anything. However, I am into traveling. I come from a big city. Which city did you find the antique store? I love treasure hunts. :-) __eou__ I went with one of my brothers to get a tattoo in Ponchatoula, we went into the antique store next to the tattoo shop. __eou__ i am so jealous!!! that sounds amazing. on a teacher's salary I don't get out of town often, but when I do...visit exotic, unheard of places-priority. __eou__ That's fun. I don't get to travel much either because I have two dogs I would have to board.  __eou__ awww I've always wanted a dog. I've only had cats, which I love, but you can't really bring them places. :-( __eou__ So where is the coolest place you have visited? __eou__ Cancun. Niagra Falls. I'm interested in Hawaii or Bora Bora. :-) __eou__ Wow! I would love to visit Peru and check out the Inca ruins. What grade do you teach?
When my girls were younger and playing softball sometimes I couldn't make it to all of their games. __eou__ Oh no, I know that must make you feel bad, but you can't always be there. __eou__ They love softball but I used to play when I was little and got kidnapped by my uncle one day after practice so softball games make me feel sad. __eou__ I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy. __eou__ Yes, my dad is a nice guy but my uncle is evil. __eou__ Do you have the same relationship with your Dad? __eou__ No. My uncle kidnapped me and my dad did not. __eou__ Well, I guess it's good that you don't remember! Did either of your parents ever marry another person? __eou__ I do remember. No, my parents are still married to each other.
The other day I was watching alpine skiing on TV. I am amazed at their skills. __eou__ Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied?  __eou__ Yeah that is impressive, No, I have not skied, but I should...got size 10 feet! LMAO i love simple jokes... __eou__ i have not but i should try it ! __eou__ Im not really into Cold weather but my roomie is an avid skier, in the winter, all he does is ski and watch cartoons #nolife __eou__ It's typically not as cold on the mountain, the air is thinner and usually dry. It's warmer that you'd think __eou__ I don't know, he's tried to convince me to go. But, I get snowed out just watching his South Park ...lol
My mom made a cake for my brother's birthday so I can't touch it until he eats first. __eou__ Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now? __eou__ I am so hungry.  especially for cake,. I love cake.  what is your favourite kind of cake? __eou__ i love cake , any kind . how about you ? __eou__ chocolate cake or angel food cake __eou__ I like white chocolate the best __eou__ my mom used to hide foil wrapped quarters in my birthday cakes when I was young __eou__ that sounds very dangerous. questionable parenting skills, there. __eou__ not dangerous at all.  we knew they were in there and would destroy our piece of cake first to find them.  __eou__ But why even make the cake? __eou__ we still eat the cake after we find the coins.  it's still yummy __eou__ Are you going to carry on the tradition with your kids? __eou__ I don't have kids.  __eou__ You're lucky. Keep it that way. It makes you hate responsibility.
I went to Panera Bread for dinner earlier. __eou__ Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours, squatting for free internet? __eou__ Nope, 500 page novel for 5 hours __eou__ That sounds unnecessarily intense. __eou__ As intesnse as a panera bread can get __eou__ For me cooking is intense. I stay up all night cooking quite often. __eou__ Thats why you dont mix weed with adderall __eou__ I hear that stuff is bad for you. __eou__ You heard right __eou__ Sometimes the bad is the most fun, though. Unfortunately. __eou__ Thats why brown foods are delish __eou__ That's the truth. __eou__ You can lose the most weight eating only purple foods __eou__ What's so special about purple? __eou__ because there pretty much isnt any
i like chicken and beef and meat __eou__ yum . i like to make lasagna and it s so good __eou__ what kind do you make? __eou__ I like meat too, but sometimes a spinach and white sauce lasagna hits the spot.  __eou__ awesome, I live alone in my condo so it can be hard to make good food sometimes __eou__ Consider one of those meal services that send you a box with all the ingredients. They may change your life. __eou__ I definitely will.  What sort of hobbies do you like? __eou__ Ok, I know it's wild, but I dress my dog in different outfits and stage photo shoots to make calendars. He is just too cute! __eou__ lol that sounds very fun, can image it being a good hobby.  What dog breed is your favorite? __eou__ Blue heeler. I want another one and my parents said they will get me one when I finish grad school. I am in my last year. __eou__ ah I see.  I like to ride by bike mainly __eou__ Do you have a mountain bike, cruiser, or a road type?  __eou__ mountain usually, enjoy dirt trails near my home __eou__ Thats cool. I take my dog hiking on the trace near my house.

I'm an only child. So we're tight. __eou__ That's amazing, I missed out on some years after a falling out with my parents __eou__ That's sad. Did you repair the relationship? __eou__ yes, we are working on it.   __eou__ I have the same situation with an uncle of mine who abused my dog in front of me. I'm trying to forgive him. __eou__ I wouldn't forgive him for that.  There's no excuse for that kind of behavior.  __eou__ I agree. But he's family. You know? That means something. __eou__ is he even remorseful? __eou__ No. He's just an angry person and the rest of us have to accept that about him. __eou__ You don't have to accept that.  That's not how family treats other members (including animals), I wouldn't consider him family.  __eou__ I'm a Christian. It's what we do.
i run a lot , my wife cut out of me . it is cool . __eou__ i like the new colorful trends in running clothes __eou__ I think my favorite path to run is through central park what about you? __eou__ I love it there, it is so calming and peaceful. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge. haha __eou__ Oh wow that seems like a very long run.. from NYC to TN __eou__ haha. I was referring to the gang of pigeon's in NY. __eou__ Oh I understand now! Yeah, but they are better than the geese __eou__ they can be a turn off for running in the parks, and make me consider running on the treadmill, but love the action of outdoors. __eou__ I do too it just isn't the same on the treadmill. You cant replace the feeling of the cool crisp NY air __eou__ Yeah, running in outdoors is more satisfying to me. So colorful. Fuels an artist's imagination. __eou__ Ahh so you are an artist! WHat is your preferred method of crafting? __eou__ a teacher, but I dabble on my own time, of course, on the canvas. __eou__ That's wonderful! What do you prefer to paint? __eou__ florals, and stills, currently. Yourself?
what do you do for a living ? __eou__ not sure . __eou__ Do you even have trouble paying for things if you are unsure what you do for a living? __eou__ Yes, I enjoy handling the money and the fact I am not in high school anymore. __eou__ How do you get the money if you do not have a job? __eou__ I was fortunate enough to inherit a trust fund, and you? __eou__ That is awesome! I am a manager for a trucking company I work a lot. __eou__ Interesting! Do you have a family?  Long hours can be hard away from family. __eou__ Yeah but sometimes I struggle paying bills so to keep the lights on I have to work those long hours. __eou__ I was always told that the reward for a "good deed" can actually be found in the deed itself.  You sound like a very responsible individual.   __eou__ That is very nice of you to say, so since you don't work do you take a lot of cool vacations? __eou__ I believe that we need to inject light anywhere we find darkness. We can't save everyone but by changing one life we can effect the future. __eou__ I would agree with you on that you make some good points. __eou__ Have you ever considered switching careers?
are you depressed my mommy gets like that sometimes cause dad works a lot __eou__ no its a disability . i also am forced to work from home too . __eou__ That is good that you are overcoming it and still working. __eou__ It's tough but I am doing better now! __eou__ That is great news what do you do with your spare time? __eou__ I do a lot of gaming and streaming along with some music production! __eou__ That is really cool I have never met anyone that does music production how did you get into that? __eou__ Well, I wanted to turn my eternal suffering into something others can enjoy.  I just downloaded some software and played with it for awhile. __eou__ You sure turned a negative into a positive thing. __eou__ It is always better to find the light in the darkness. __eou__ I am young so I am very optimistic about life. __eou__ That is great to hear!  Keep that optimism as long as you can, you can do great things with it! __eou__ Yeah my parents are that way and I look up to them a lot.  __eou__ Good parents lead to great children is what I say.
I am proud of my girlfriend for getting a new job, she makes more than me now __eou__ That's awesome!   What does she do? __eou__ She is the shift lead on the taco truck now!  What about yours? __eou__ A taco truck sounds fun!  __eou__ It sure is! I love tacos myself so it's great for me! __eou__ I like to be alone so my girlfriend and I work different shifts. She is a waitress __eou__ That would be nice, sounds lovely!  Does she enjoy it? __eou__ For the most part. She works handling a lot of cash. Can't be all bad, right? __eou__ Not at all, I work in a "cash only" business myself! __eou__ I say whatever brings home the bacon!  __eou__ As long as I'm putting food on the table nobody is asking questions. __eou__ As long as the bills are paid!  __eou__ As long as I'm decked out in Louis V head to toe I am happy. __eou__ Good taste in style and food, I hear you. I'm a social media content creator for a well known company. What do you do?
I believe it was and a lot of other companies tried to emulate those IBMs, which were created with that processor. How fast were those processors, any idea? __eou__ The Intel 80386 was introduced in 1085 and it was 32-bit so in comparison to today's standards probably really slow but a massive evolution back in the day! __eou__ right? and here we are!! tomorrow flying cars...I hope so and I'd love to work on them! I hate my job... __eou__ Do you think self-driving cars would help?  Those would be fun to work on also! __eou__ Well, not so sure about that, after that crazy crash with Tesla. But, i'd love to explore alternate transportation options...Beam me up! __eou__ Indeed, Elon Musk is a genius though, Hes made the Tesla Powerwall, Powerpack batteries, solar panels and solar roof tiles for people all over the world. __eou__ Agree totally...and we need to be collectively and seriously exploring all options away from fossil fuel without a doubt. __eou__ What do you think about solar? I hope we can pave the planet with panels someday! __eou__ Solar is a great option, but also worry about the balance of nature vs technology. Its all about balance __eou__ I see, how do you think we can balance technology with our lives? __eou__ Envision this, "This used to be Yellowstone National Park, but now every living tree and plant has been removed to be a monstrous solar field"...ugh __eou__ I can see your point, it is definitely a balancing act!@ __eou__ Life is an evolution, but I enjoy exploring the potential options that's for sure __eou__ Explore while you are still young.  Once you get married and have kids it's all over.
I prefer the American side, such as Rage Against the Machine.  __eou__ I am more into the 80's, Poison is one of my favorite bands, that came out in the 1980s! __eou__ I am not a huge 80s fan myself but I don't know enough 80's music to pass certain judgement!  __eou__ You should check it out. Google "hair bands". __eou__ Like Van Halen?? __eou__ Yeah! Eddie all the way! __eou__ I am a big Tool fan myself! __eou__ I love that dude. "3 Libras" is perfect. __eou__ Now we're talking! You are a man of culture. __eou__ What is your taste in movies? What's the best movie you ever saw? __eou__ I am a big fan of weird movies.  The best movie I've ever seen is Alejandro Jaderovsky's The Holy Mountain.  What about you? __eou__ Hanna. But I'll check that out. __eou__ I haven't seen that one, I'll give it a look tonight!  Thank you __eou__ What about music? What is the best song you ever heard? __eou__ The best song I've ever heard? That is a hard one but I would have to say "Peace, Love , and Understanding" by A Perfect Circle
It couldnt be true, I know that wa my mom, but the man she was with wasnt my dad. __eou__ Wow! Did you confront her about it? __eou__ Yes I did I was so heart broken and thinking how could I tell my dad.  __eou__ How did you do it, or what did you say to her? __eou__ I just let her know she was wrong and that if she didn't tell my dad then I would. Crazy thing the guy looked like Robert Deniro. __eou__ Did she say how long it was going on for? __eou__ Yes she said it has only been going on for 3 months she met him at the beach during our family surfing trip smh. How would you react?  __eou__ During a family trip?! I would be upset, especially hearing it was during that trip!  Do you think she will tell your dad? __eou__ My exact thinking like how could you during family memories. She has no choice if she don't I will.  __eou__ How long did you give her to tell him? __eou__ I didn't give her one. How long should I give her before spilling the truth?  __eou__ I would give her a week, or do you think that is too much time? __eou__ I was thinking the same thing but it is really eating me up on the inside to hold this secret. My dad is going to be devastated. __eou__ I'm sure it will hurt a lot but at least you can be there for him. __eou__ I know thanks for helping cope with this going surfing now that's my favorite and will ease my mind. 
I can't wait for February __eou__ Oh yeah? What's so special about it? __eou__ I planned my first cruise to Alaska __eou__ Your first cruise? Or first one to Alaska? __eou__ Both!  Im so excited __eou__ A cruise would suit me well. I only eat fish, so I'd fit in nicely. __eou__ I love fish.  I like to fish and eat them.  I am primarily a fish eater myself. __eou__ I'm on a weird diet where the only thing I can eat is fish. I'm kind of sick of it. __eou__ Some fish are great for you.  They say that everyone should incorporate it in a weekly diet. __eou__ Yeah. I forget what it is they have. Oxy-something or something. But it's hard because of all the media that says how dangerous it can be. __eou__ Very true but the media likes to over exagerate things also.  I would recommend eating what your comfortable with and what our body is going to handle. __eou__ Well, I'm a Democrat. So I kind of trust the news. __eou__ Nothing wrong with that.  To each their own opinions __eou__ That's why I can't stomach Fox News. It's all opinion. No truth.
So last night I heard a window break in my house. So i jumped up and grabbed my gun to go check it out __eou__ Oh man, I hope everything is ok , and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb. __eou__ Yeah I didn't see what it was that caused the noise. I'm disable so it's hard for me to get around fast. __eou__ oh wow   i'm sorry to hear that __eou__ It's okay, nothing happened to me. Which is good. The last thing I needed was another medical bill __eou__  Good.  Medi __eou__ I'm not sure what you mean by that. I have a weird disorder that makes it hard to chew food. __eou__ i meant medical attention is very expensive.  Do you need to puree all your food in order to eat __eou__ It's okay if I'm eating softer foods like bananas. But my days of eating steak are over. __eou__ i love steak,  but i love mountain dews more __eou__ I have no problems with having to worry about chewing soda! __eou__ LOL  no problems at all      how do you spend time during the day __eou__ A lot of it is dedicated to going to doctors, but in my free time I like to play chess __eou__ i love playing chess.  i joined a chess club in town, played at the meeting last nite
Yeah, you're right. I think that's why I'm so fascinated when I see foreign languages. The meaning we connect to images or orders of symbols are so interesting __eou__ well most people think that reading is a means of language acquisition, communitcaition and sharing of information and i deas __eou__ i love to read because it is easier to gain knowledge through literature since you can interpret the words how you want __eou__ I enjoy reading as well it takes me to a new world. __eou__ people also have a habit of allowing their biases to show through when speaking to one another. even teachers do it __eou__ Everyone should be allowed to think for themselves without all the outside influences. __eou__ i completely agree. having the information is vital but i think its more important to have objective, factual information first to form your own opinion __eou__ I definitely agree with you on that. __eou__ it's actually insane how people can teach children things and skew their entire world view. __eou__ Yes, that is very true people try and shape young minds to fit their beliefs. __eou__ i think that's part of why being a parent today is how hard, especially when so much of the world is still unconscious __eou__ The world is so much different now than when I was a kid being a parent would be hard. __eou__ it definitely is. i have two and my partner and i are very different people. __eou__ I can't imagine. I don't have any yet but I fear for the world they will grow up in.
Have you ever been to Six flags? __eou__ I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much, as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you? __eou__ I love rides.  Not as much as I did when I was a kid, but my kids love them and want me to go on rides with them.  __eou__ What is your favorite ride? __eou__ Goliath __eou__ OH! That's a big one. I think I read somewhere that it goes nearly 90mph! __eou__ yes and it has  (at one point) the longest drop of 75m. I also like any water ride.  __eou__ Water rides are pretty cool most of them don't have as steep of drops so they tend to be easier on me. __eou__ I get a headache on most roller coasters because of the banging around.  __eou__ yeah they can definitely be strenuous. I would much rather be at home playing video games __eou__ I love the sights and sounds of an amusement park, and the food.  __eou__ Me too. I'm not really a big fan of rides but the food is the best part! __eou__ I love funnel cakes __eou__ Funnel cakes are the best!!
I really miss living in the city __eou__ I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps.  __eou__ At the same time, I really enjoy the stars in the country. With less city lights they really pop. __eou__ I understand that. I look at the sky a lot at night when I am walking back home after college __eou__ Do you have any class trips scheduled? We are planning a trip to Japan. __eou__ Not that I know of. What you plan to visit in Japan? __eou__ We are studying small scale farming. They are limited in space so planning is key. So, lot of farms.  __eou__ Is there a lot of farms in Japan? Its a populated area so large farms are probably rare. __eou__ Their are quite a few. I really hope I can save enough to make the trip and hopefully a little extra so I can get some legit sushi! __eou__ I am also a big fan of sushi! When my football team win, we usually go to a sushi place after the game. __eou__ Ah-yum! What are you studying in school? __eou__ I am a student in criminology __eou__ Aaahhh! What kind of job are you hoping to get? __eou__ I don't know yet, probably a private investigator or a position in the police. __eou__ Good luck.
wow , awesome . i just work at a grocery store right now . __eou__ that is still nice . are you a checker ? __eou__ I do night stock actually, I don't have to deal with many customers! __eou__ It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's great __eou__ So what do you do for work?  __eou__ I work as an analyst, headquartered in Bentonville. __eou__ How do you like it? What do you do in your free time? __eou__ I do sales work!

We have some great free range bacon for sale. __eou__ my goodness ! i'm going to have to go get some .
I may have heard a few. I cant be to sure though. __eou__ Many of the songs trace back to Africa, and even Great Britain. __eou__ Oh? I'd love to hear those.

There has been some controversy as of late, but I know they used to be good for boys and teaching them outdoor skills. __eou__ Yes, I know they had some good programs and have been around since about 1910, with over 110 million members, but I just didn't know how much a child truly enjoyed it. __eou__ Hello, how long have you had braces? I have studied science myself in college.  __eou__ Ive had braces 3 years.  I have a bachelors of science degree also.   __eou__ That is interesting.

I believe that they share common traits with anteaters and sloths. __eou__ Interesting. The name Armadillo comes from the Spanish word meaning "little armored one" fittingly enough. __eou__ That is great maybe I should tell my son __eou__ You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently. __eou__ Armilldillos are like wart hogs and an cross between ant eaters. __eou__ Like those scrawny penguins? That would make me want to bench press a polar bear. ! __eou__ I love animals but raw power of watching them chase people.. and the hype __eou__ Zoom, zoom. They need to keep up with me and try my super armadillo recipe. Hope they are ok, and not too weak. __eou__ Well I have to select the cat side first, cause cats are more stealth than an the turtoise genious __eou__ They are not strong and fast, they are weak. My daughter needs to toughen up that child. Otherwise, I have not laid eyes on a tuxedo cat. __eou__ True, very true if that animals shells is worth making an good shield and other battle gear
My co-worker makes almost double the amount I do and yet does about half the work... __eou__ That is so messed up. __eou__ Its probably because he is a man __eou__ Have you talked to management about it? maybe they are unaware __eou__ No, I just feel like they would not take it seriously __eou__ You should try, or bring it up to HR. At least bring it to light so others see what is going on __eou__ Maybe I should see if it is the same with all my coworkers first, then if it is, I won't have to talk to HR alone about it.  __eou__ That might be a good idea. Unless he's been there more than twice as long and recieved that many more raises it isn't fair.  __eou__ Yeah I guess you have a point there. I will make sure I talk to someone about it by the end of the week.  __eou__ maybe you will uncover something big. If more men are making double than women, it may show pattern and you can get something done about it __eou__ I just hope that I would not be causing any problems if that is true.  __eou__ Well if its true, you wouldnt be causing a problem, you would be bringing an injustice to light __eou__ Thanks it feels good to have an outside perspective on this __eou__ You're welcome. Hopefully it will get fixed and they will be fair

That's a good song! How do you feel about the song Hey Joe? __eou__ It's okay. However, credits and claims have led to confusion about the song's real author. __eou__ How do you mean?

Are you from a different region than those people?  __eou__ Yeah. I'm from Florida in the US, but my grammer, semantics and dialect seem no different to me than those of my friends elsewhere. __eou__ I've never been to Florida, but I hear that the weather is always nice. __eou__ The weather is lovely! I love hot weather. __eou__ Speaking of hot, I recently traveled to Texas. Between all the Spanish and the southern accent, I had a hard time keeping up. __eou__ We do have thick accents, but our food is amazing. __eou__ I heard good things about the fried conch in Florida.

I like fish and shrimp. __eou__ I know Florida is known for oranges, but I recently learned that it is also a big producer of strawberries. Are they better or cheaper there? __eou__ I personally think they are better, though not necessarily cheaper. __eou__ Still . . . nice weather, great food . . . sounds like a great place for a visit. __eou__ I'd say it is. They also have a lot of coastline there. More than any other state in the US.

Plus, I get to meet so many people and know that I am providing a place for them to relax and enjoy a quality meal.  __eou__ My wife is the same way. __eou__ Does she also manage a restaurant?  __eou__ Yes! Italian cuisine. Family-oriented. __eou__ That must be so rewarding!  Nothing brings people together like a good meal!  It's not always easy work, but it's also nice knowing we make people happy! __eou__ My wife feels the same. I'm more of a loner. A misanthrope, even. __eou__ That;s not a bad thing, either!  I'm sure she appreciates the support you provide after a busy day!   __eou__ Well, seeing as how I don't like people that much--which I learned during the war--I don't support her much. __eou__ Life throws us many challenges.

I wish we had cooler weather here.  __eou__ We don't get much snow here maybe one good day. __eou__ Its hot in the south. __eou__ i would think it is too hot . __eou__ Yep.  I agree.  Ive never been out of the country. __eou__ thats a shame
sweet . how old are you ? __eou__ 31 . i like hiking on the wends __eou__ I'm only 18 and I still live at home. __eou__ DO you live in an urban area or closer to nature? __eou__ The burbs. But there's woods behind the house. __eou__ There is a lot of math found in nature. Are you familiar with the Fibonacci Sequence? __eou__ No. What's that? __eou__ The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. __eou__ Isn't that like a spiral or something to do with shells? __eou__ Yes, the swirls, also known as the "Golden Ratio" found throughout nature. __eou__ I heard about that in a science class, I think. Kind of over my head, though. __eou__ I disliked math class myself but am intrigued how it applies to our natural world.  After all, math IS just a theory.
ok , i shall call you luke __eou__ do you have any siblings ? __eou__ I have two older half brothers, one younger half brother, and a younger half sister.  __eou__ I have three older siblings. Do you wish you were an only child? __eou__ Well I consider myself an only child actually, because I never lived with my siblings. I hated it to be honest. It was lonely. __eou__ Your parents should have gotten you a pet. I had a dog and it was wonderful. __eou__ Fortunately we almost always had a dog. That did help a lot for sure. I began working online as a side gig recently and my dog keeps me company. __eou__ That's great, what kind of side gig? I'm doing something similar right now. __eou__ I have two actually. One of them I go places, take pictures, and answer questions. I eat meat so it's good they have pizza mystery shopping. __eou__ That sounds fun. Does it pay well? __eou__ Certain ones really do. It follows your location if you want it too, so when traveling, I do jobs along the way and pay for gas or the trip itself! __eou__ How nice. I could use some supplemental income. __eou__ Can't we all. I know it definitely helps support my family, especially while my wife is out of work. __eou__ You sound like a real stand-up guy
My husband wants to go parasailing together when we go to Mexico next month. __eou__ That is very nice thing to do. __eou__ It seems like it! I always love vacationing. Do you ever go on vacation? __eou__ No, but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been? __eou__ I have, actually! I love cruises. Cozmuel is beautiful. I love cooking, but the best thing about cruises is everyone else doing it! __eou__ I recently learned that there are cruises that  __eou__ They go everywhere! Some even to Europe. __eou__ That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries __eou__ Maybe one day! You never know what's in store for your future. :) what do you do for a living? __eou__ I'm a freelancer __eou__ Oh! What kind of freelance? __eou__ marketing actually. __eou__ oh, very cool. I've done some freelance work myself, it's hard - but having your own hours is great. __eou__ yes it definitely is !
its going well . spent the day outside . do you have any pets ? __eou__ no . . i have kids though __eou__ Those are way harder to deal with than pets. __eou__ Yes they are sometime, but they are useful right now. __eou__ How so? __eou__ I am in a wheel chair, so they help me get around town. __eou__ Oh yes, I'm sure they are very helpful right now.  Someday I will probably wish I got along with people better than animals. __eou__ You are not a social type of person? __eou__ Not really.  I find it hard to relate to people. __eou__ Some people are pretty cool when you start knowing them. __eou__ It's just so hard to find a place to meet new people. __eou__ Think of your favorite hobby, and find a group interested in the same hobby as you in your city. Thats the best way. __eou__ That's a good idea. I enjoy photographing animals, what are your hobbies? __eou__ I watch birds around my house and do some gardening.
I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning. __eou__ Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on __eou__ Some mornings my cat is on the bed, a little bundle of heat next to me. __eou__ My cat is usually sleeping on top of me in the morning.  I am always trying to move him without waking him up. __eou__ I do that also, but then he decides he wants his breakfast, and then it's hard to ignore him. __eou__ Mine is the same and he asks loudly! __eou__ And then after he eats, he can spend the rest of the day sleeping.  But I have to stay up and go to work. __eou__ I am retired, and if I sit down for even a minute my cat is in my lap.  He can be a nuisance  __eou__ Maybe offices would be more fun if we had cats at our desks. __eou__ That I totally agree with, there is something soothing and comforting about hearing a cat purring. __eou__ I think retirement will be better than working in many respects, not just cat availability. __eou__ I love retirement.  How far from retirement are you? __eou__ Hopefully just a few years. I think about it a lot! __eou__ Well I think the secret to a happy retirement is to find something you like to do.  Sitting around can get very boring, stay busy.
My dog is walking a bit slower these days, he's 15. __eou__ what breed is he? __eou__ A king Shepherd. __eou__ Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up, my kind of dog __eou__ His name is Tundra, solid white, and weighs 130lbs. __eou__ I love his name, I bet he is beautiful! __eou__ He is quite the "Marshmallow" although he looks intimidating if you do not know him. __eou__ Has he been with you his entire life? __eou__ I rescued him 1.5 yrs. ago.  He was found chained to a tree and partially frozen to the ground outside of Chicago. __eou__ My goodness that's horrible, good thing you came along. __eou__ He has become like velcro...do you have pets? __eou__ Not currently, I had a dog but let my son take him when he moved out. __eou__ Do you play any instruments? __eou__ No, do you? 
My life is going so great right now! __eou__ That's fantastic to hear! __eou__ Yes, it is always good to be on track  __eou__ Staying on track is great, best way I have found is to stay prepared. I just put up money in case my 20 year old car breaks.
I think everyday how fortunate I am to have a house, car, food, water and air to breathe. There are so many people in the world who don't even have clean water to drink __eou__ You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most. __eou__ Agreed. When I'm having a bad day, I think about how bad the people in third world countries have it. __eou__ we need to more for them, you dont see enough of it on social media __eou__ So true. It amazes me how much people fail to realize their fortunes. I watch people in bars act like they have not a single care in the world. __eou__ agreed __eou__ Being an angry person already, it just makes matters worse, ya know? __eou__ you are so right there i suppose __eou__ It makes me want to be more approachable so I can inform people on the horrors other countries have to endure. __eou__ yeah i would love to see how the rest of the world lives __eou__ Hopefully one day we all can. Like the people in Venezuela who are without food, water and many without electricity! __eou__ i know that's so horrible . so many have perished already __eou__ And I'm sure a lot more will as well, sadly. Hopefully we can find a way to help them. __eou__ i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in . __eou__ Helping our neighbors is our duty as humans. Personally, it could even help with my anger problems!
I like tacos are the mexican food? __eou__ It is similar to a taco, but it is cylindrical in shape and closed ended. __eou__ This is true; what do you think about shoes? __eou__ I would think you would want shoes to support you so you don't roll your ankle.
i think i am a purple belt in pasta and a brown belt in pizza . __eou__ ll . noodles are just cheap , and going to college while working is expensive . __eou__ I eat a lot of noodles. I like to add cheese and meat when possible. Where do you work? __eou__ work in the library at the small community college I attend. it doesn't pay that great but I have access to the material for school. how about you? __eou__ I help my grandma she makes jewelry. I sell it online.  __eou__ sounds like she keeps busy. do you help with making the jewelry, as well? do you sell on sites like craigslist or do you have your own webpage? __eou__ Yes. It is fun . a lot on ebay. __eou__ that's a way to make a buck! Ebay's a great place to get an idea about prices.  It is a multinational e-commerce corporation. go you entrepreneur! __eou__ Thanks. Do you have any hobbies?  __eou__ well, I've gotten so many ideas from this site. small hobbies that can go big. A cake baker, investing, and now jewelry making... wow. hobbies. who knew? __eou__ Funny, I wish I was better at saving and investing. Do you like your school? __eou__ That's inspirational at least. I'm sure we can all do better at saving. School is.. an experience that I'm appreciative of. It's a step to the next level. __eou__ I hear you. School is stressful sometimes. What did you eat today?  __eou__ nothing healthy! :-) basically ramen chicken flavored. and coffee! what a combination. haha now that I see it in writing. will do better. :-D
I tried java, but it was too tedious. What other programs do you use? __eou__ Pretty much only Java.  Have you tried Sencha Touch? __eou__ No i haven't. What is it about? __eou__ It helps you create JavaScript applications. We use it at the school where I'm a teacher. __eou__ I enjoy creating websites but havent heard about it __eou__ It is pretty easy to use, you should look into it! Do you create websites for work? __eou__ No, I do them for myself __eou__ Oh, nice! I've been wanting to build my own website, but I've been going through a hard time and it's taking all my energy. __eou__ I've been doing a lot of things for myself lately. I want to start investing money __eou__ Really, what is a good place to invest money? __eou__ I don't know. I just started to do some research __eou__ Well, I guess I have plenty of time to do my own research, now that I'm single. I wish you luck in your investments!  __eou__ Thank you. Good luck to you too. __eou__ Thank you, maybe I can focus on doing something with art since that's what I teach! My future is looking bright!
I just got a bunch of bills in. __eou__ That is never a good feeling __eou__ It's not! Especially as I'm saving up for plane tickets __eou__ Go get booking you know you want to ;) __eou__ Yeah I can't wait. Learning about different cultures is my passion. What about you? __eou__ Love for country __eou__ Oh, nice. I'm a veteran so I'm super patriotic __eou__ military veteran that travels and discovers new cultures __eou__ yep that's me in a nutshell. Love my country, love to learn about other ones __eou__ I wish one day I would be able to serve my country along those brave man and woman who are serving to protect our country __eou__ It's a noble calling that's for sure __eou__ I respect those who gave their lives to our country.I too had many family members in the military __eou__ That's awesome. You must be really proud of them __eou__ done
i love dogs . i make clay models of all my dogs and they look very life like __eou__ nice ! i love my dog , he is pretty much my closest friend lol . __eou__ My dog is as well. And he even likes his clay model. lol I've also made a clay model of mount Everest as I hope to climb it someday! __eou__ Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it! __eou__ Indeed. Although it would take a long time to prep considering the danger and conditions, ya know? __eou__ That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, but accomplishing that would be entirely worth it.  __eou__ So true. It's just too bad I couldn't take my dogs with me, right? Ha! __eou__ haha definitely not! That would be way too dangerous. So what else are you into? __eou__ I enjoy a nice classic movie every now and again. Matter of fact, I watched Gone With The Wind recently and it always makes me cry. __eou__ Oh okay! I've always heard about it, but unfortunately have never watched it. I love movies in general though.  __eou__ It's a real tear jerker and it was controversial at the time because they used the "D" word in it. __eou__ Well I __eou__ Of course, these days that word is so common, it's practically nothing. lol
i'm sorry you never got to meet him __eou__ its all good . i get all the love i need from work . haha __eou__ He was in the military when I was in the 70s. __eou__ It's so nice to talk to someone who knew my dad! So I guess you guys fought side by side in the war? __eou__ We fought side by side and we ate side by side. Only red meat of course! We were good friends. __eou__ Haha, well I'm a vegetarian so I guess I didn't get that from him. I love mushrooms and pasta, especially ravioli! What was his job in the military? __eou__ Military police. He commanded the 110th division. Great man.  __eou__ Well, that's something we have in common! I have always had a desire to be a police officer. __eou__ Have you taken steps to acheive this dream? __eou__ I was a junior police officer when I was a teenager and it was great! Since then I've been scared to take the leap! __eou__ Thats too bad. You should always chase the dreams of your youth. __eou__ Thanks for the encouragement!! Do you feel like you've accomplished your dreams? You're life seems fascinating! __eou__ I beleive I have. I was kicked out of the military for beating up a general who misappropriated MRE rations. __eou__ Wow, that's intense, were you starving?
i'm still in college , going to be a lawyer one day . __eou__ lots of work . i used to drive a big rig , now i just fix them . much simpler . __eou__ where did you learn to fix rigs?  __eou__ Its self thought. I worked so much with trucks. I know everything about them __eou__ What kind of things did you transport when you drove your big rig? Butterflies? __eou__ I was transporting huge wood logs around America. __eou__ I see, what was the wood going to be used for? I bet the butterflies will miss them. __eou__ All sort of thing from furniture to paper. Butterflies are living more in meadows than forest. So no real harms was done. __eou__ Thank you for expanding my knowledge of butterflies! I love them so much. You know, my favourite hero Flash could assemble furniture in a flash. __eou__ Is flash part of the avenger? I don't have a lot of knowledge in super heroes __eou__ I think he is part of the Marvel universe, but not an Avenger. Sometimes I get DC and Marvel superheroes confused. I am ashamed I do not know this. __eou__ They all confuse me. I was a big fan of x-men though when I was younger. __eou__ How exciting! I am also an X-Men fan. I loved the cartoons and my favourite hero is the blue gorilla. Who was your favourite?  __eou__ My favorite is wolverine of course. The only one who can stop phoenix. __eou__ Wolverine is very cool, but Hugh Jackman is too tall to play him. He is supposed to be much shorter, like myself. Dumbledore has a phoenix too you know. 
Absolutely! Have you ever been to any of them? __eou__ Yeah I went to several of them when I visited DC 10 years ago. They do a good job of serving the general public. __eou__ For sure. I'm not one to have many friends at once, so working in the museum is perfect for me. It's quiet and I meet a lot of people. __eou__ Yeah.  Lots of historical signifigance there.  Like DEaly plaza where JFK was killed.  Conspiracy nuts love it. __eou__ My favorites are natural history museums. I have a keen interest in animals and nature in general. __eou__ I like Green museums. The help people be more conscious of their world and it's limitations and how their actions affect it. __eou__ Those are nice too! You sound like you know your way around museums yourself. __eou__ yes a few . i like to visit museums for inspirations sometimes . __eou__ What are some of your other hobbies or interests? __eou__ I like visiting art museums. State and local art museums are similar but where they differ is the collection itself. __eou__ Ah yes, city museums, especially those in smaller cities or towns, are easily overlooked. Many hidden gems out there. __eou__ Yea they even have artifact galleries you can look at. __eou__ I visited a huge museum I believe in Jackson, Wyoming that I particularly loved. Buffalo Bill museum or something like that. __eou__ Oh wow. My favorite one has to be the D-Day Museum in New Orleans
I know the name but can't remember what he drew/draws. Do you know what he was known for? __eou__ Yes Peanuts cartoon strips. He had several movies for entertainment and advertising done with the gang. __eou__ Is that the one with with the yellow sponge guy? __eou__ No with Charlie Brown and Snoopy __eou__ Was snoopy a spie? __eou__ Not that I know of. __eou__ Oh...I must be thinking of something else.  Do you play an instrument? __eou__ no, do you? __eou__ Yes, a kazoo! I also have mad skills with the tambourine. __eou__ lol, i used to love those. __eou__ It's never to late to rekindle those moments LOL a harmonica may be in your future! __eou__ those always been cool. Do you draw? __eou__ Yes, I design handbags. __eou__ So nice! Do you have a website?
Yes, those are great games. I enjoy the latest one, myself. GTA V __eou__ The series is very popular. The first installment has sold more than 150 million copes as of Sept. 2013. __eou__ Wow, that's amazing. One of those copies is mine lol __eou__ My boyfriend loves playing GTA as well he will spend hours on the game console playing. __eou__ That's awesome. Do you like playing with him? __eou__ Mostly.  He really has to guide me so I know what to do.  It's a very complex game. __eou__ It is! My partner doesn't mind watching me play but she gets so bored watching me play football haha __eou__ The game has been around since 2005, but I've only started playing recently. __eou__ Oh, nice. It's never too late to start! I've been gaming my whole life __eou__ I just have to make sure I take a break. They say sitting down too long is bad for you. __eou__ That's so true. I always try to do something physical between every game __eou__ I'm a big reader, so I spend a lot of time sitting down no matter what.  __eou__ Oh really? What are your favorite books? I don't read much except for the sports pages haha __eou__ I enjoy poetry, but I love fantasy novels.
I have a dentist appointment next week. __eou__ Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists. __eou__ I am a snakeskin oil salesman, could I interest you in a tonic? __eou__ What kind of tonic are you offering? __eou__ It helps with hair growth, increases brain performance, and brings good luck. Just 5 payments of 9.99 __eou__ Wow, that's 3 great things in one!  Is the fee negotiable? __eou__ Yes, absolutely. I stare at people from a distance. That is my idea of how to flirt. How about you? __eou__ No, that's kind of creepy.  How about $5.00? __eou__ I get that a lot. For you I will do 4.99. I will throw in 10 shamwows if you pay the shipping and handling. __eou__ What is a shamwow? __eou__ It is a legendary towel made popular by a television salesman. It is super absorbent.  __eou__ Sounds great, I bet I could re-sell it for 3 easy payments of $9.99. __eou__ Absolutely, there is no greater investment for you and your family. I like to help people. __eou__ Well, just bill my wife for the tonic.  She wishes I had more hair anyway. 
It's the fear of wide open spaces. It can also be fear of crowds, which would cause social anxiety and even traveling short distances. __eou__ That sounds really difficult. Can it be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy? __eou__ Most likely but even Xanax and other anxiety drugs really help. __eou__ I have found that daily yoga and a strict vegetarian diet eliminate stress for me. __eou__ I'll have to look into that. Cooking, believe it or not, is also therapeutical for me as I'm also a gourmet cook. __eou__ See. I'm not a great cook. __eou__ It took years to learn but once you get it down pat, it's enjoyable and you'd be surprised at how good you can be at it.
Really?I don't, I wouldn't know how to use it anyway.  Of course in the movies hostage situations can be entertaining, I guess. __eou__ i go to the range with my husband so he taught me how to use it. have you ever heard about bride kidnapping? it's also known as marriage by abduction __eou__ I've heard of it.. I actually was held hostage once during a store robbery. __eou__ Oh wow, I am glad you are okay. Nothing you can do to avoid it in public but I have a dog for home protection. __eou__ I don't have a dog right now.. but we had one growing up.. my dad wasn't home much as he was a cop at the time. __eou__ I am always home baking and cooking. I would worry about a family member having such a dangerous job. __eou__ Well he's retired now.. so fortunately it worked out ok for him :)  I love to cook, but I'm not a very good baker :) __eou__ Aww good, I bet he enjoys retirement. That move Hostage showed how important a cops job is. __eou__ Yeah it did.. it was actually fairly accurate, too.  Law Enforcement, in general, go through a LOT of turmoil in their lives. __eou__ I have to most respect for them because they have to deal with extreme mental stress.  __eou__ Absolutely.. not a lot of jobs out there where you are literally unsure if you're going to be returning home alive at the end of the day. __eou__ That would definitely be a job I would not want, but we need heroes to stop bad people like in Hostle.  __eou__ With the way the world is, yes, we always need Heroes :) __eou__ I would hate to imagine the world without people to protect us from the crazy's in the world today.
nice , those are good goals to have in life . __eou__ i say peyton manning at the grocery store once . __eou__ That's so cool! I love the NFL. My family watches the games every week. Who is your favorite team? __eou__ I'm a Panthers fan __eou__ Awesome! I'm more of a Chicago Bears girl though. So anyway, where are you from? __eou__ I live in Tennessee, not far from Dollywood. Where are you from? __eou__ Well I was born in Spain, but when I was 12 my family moved to Illinoise work better work opportunities.  __eou__ I've been to Chicago for a couple of days, but that's about it for Illinois. Been to TN? __eou__ Yeah actually! I've been to summer camps around the Chattanooga area so I have several friends from there. Have you ever heard of Baylor Summer Camps? __eou__ No, I haven't, but I love Chattanooga. Pretty down on the riverfront. Nashville is a great city, also. Have you gone to a Bears game? __eou__ Yeah! What about you to a panthers game?  __eou__ Yeah I've been a few times when I lived in NC. It was okay, but I prefer college football games. Those are more exciting to me.
aww , what is her name ? __eou__ zoey . she turned two yesterday . __eou__ How sweet! Is Zoey your daughter? __eou__ Yes, she is.   __eou__ That is so great. I hope to have a daughter one day. __eou__ I'm sure you will.  Children are the best, but a handful.  Are you married?
i have a wife but she does not like me very much __eou__ my wife do not like me either she loves our 2 cats and the dog more __eou__ i'm sure she likes you more than you think __eou__ Yes, I agree with you on that but and she loves me regardless. __eou__ that's really nice to hear. i have 2 cats and a dog as well. __eou__ Oh wow do you. Do you have to chase after them at all? I can't do pets I hate running lol. __eou__ my cats are pretty lazy but my dog is high energy and i take him on at least 2 walks a day for 30 minutes each __eou__ Lol that sounds like a cat to me, lazy. Yes, high energy well I hate doing too much. I'd rather watch basketball. __eou__ basketball is a fun game to watch. __eou__ Agreed, I am obsessed with it and it's one of the best sports created. What's your favorite? __eou__ mine would have to be football __eou__ Ooooh, football is a good one. It's a great one for sure. Who's your favorite team? __eou__ LSU Tigers and New Orleans Saints! __eou__ Great, college team and the Saints are nice!
cool , i will be there soon . . cannot wait ! __eou__ be prepareared to rock roll ! __eou__ I wish I had more money to travel, because that is my dream.  __eou__ I'm not great at saving money to travel, but it would be nice. __eou__ I have an IQ of 250 and enjoy visiting museums and concerts. __eou__ Wow. With an IQ like that, you should be in a lab finding a cure for cancer.
i am in the inland empire __eou__ cool , have you heard of redd it ? i post on there often __eou__ I have. I have health issues and try to not eat too much red meat, so I use it for great advice from other users. __eou__ That seems like a great use of reddit, I have never been a big fan of red meat myself, always preferred other meat like chicken. __eou__ I've heard of Inland Empire. I have several homes I own throughout the country but have never been there. __eou__ I heard it is quite pretty in California, it must be nice to be so close to Los Angeles. Have you visited Los Angeles since your in the area? __eou__ I have. It's a great place for both business and leisure, but the traffic can be so heavy there. __eou__ Yeah I've heard a lot of major cities get bad traffic, so many people rely more on walking or biking when available. __eou__ What are some of your favorite chicken dishes to eat? __eou__ Personally my favorite is to cut the chicken up and throw it on top of rice with some vegetables and season it, can't forget to make it spicy. __eou__ Ah, that's how my wife likes it best too, but she doesn't like spicy. I love spicy foods in general and put hot sauce on most savory foods.
I fish for snowcrab. __eou__ Do you keep it at a port or boatyard? __eou__ I keep it at a boatyard. I have my own boat too, it makes it possible to fish for snowcrab.  __eou__ That's nice! I've been wanting to start oystering, but I'm have a baby, for the second time around. I don't think a boat would be my friend. __eou__ Oh my word! Congratulations! I eat a lot of oysters, I love eating all sorts of seafood.  __eou__ Thank you, we're getting excited! I am a vegetarian who only eats oysters. That seems funny when I say it out loud! __eou__ Ha ha! People that only eat fish meat are called pescatarians. But does that include oysters? I am not sure.  __eou__ Lol, I'm not sure either! Labels can be confusing. I'm an artist so I just try to roll with it:) __eou__ Wow, what kind of artist are you? I love to paint fish and the sea but I am not so skilled.  __eou__ I am a photographer, my mentor is Sally Mann! Most of my pieces are on landscapes and people, the capturing of the soul. I love that you paint! __eou__ Oh, a photographer, I see. I am not familiar with Sally Mann unfortunately. I will look for her instagram. But yes, I love to finger paint, it relaxes me. __eou__ Yes, do look into her, you won't regret it. Wow! Finger painting, now that's a technique I haven't thought about for quite some time! So cool:) __eou__ I will have to try to remember my instagram password, haha! Yes, I love to finger paint, and do full body paintings, but it uses a lot of paint. __eou__ Totally, we have too many passwords to remember!! How much does it cost you to do a full body painting? __eou__ I am unsure, normally I would use up 1 bucket of paint. But taking a bath afterwards is terribly messy.  __eou__ Hahahaha! I bet:) Sorry to have to leave so soon, but my oldest child is yelling for lunch! It's been great chatting with you, hope to do it again soon!
Is that it? I never owned a Betta Fish, I had a few goldfish when I was a kid. Do you know how long those live? __eou__ I do not. I do know they are the most common kept aquarium fish though. __eou__ Oh wow I really love fish they're the best. All of my preschool classmates love them too. __eou__ They are pretty cool.  I like the king betta.  They are about 2 inches are either beige or white. __eou__ I didn't know that about the King Betta, that is awesome. Outside of Bettas I enjoy playing outside, how about you? __eou__ i'll watch them sometimes . i'd rather be outside honestly . fishing or hunting . __eou__ Agreed, outside things are so much more fun. The park is a great place to play and be with family. __eou__ right ! and all the amazing animals outside . __eou__ I know right! The butterflies are the prettiest animal I have ever seen. What's your favorite?
yes , he knew it was my favorite hobby . you married ? __eou__ no single , i am buying a house and will have a garden there . __eou__ Really?  I love gardening, what kind of plants do you plan to plant? __eou__ I want to keep it low maintenance, so that I have time to go to the beach as well, which is nearby __eou__ Understandable.  I'd recommend just evergreens then.  I wish i lived near the beach. __eou__ Good idea ! I think I'll need to do some research into conditions and soil before buying. Do you surf ? __eou__ No, but I love the ocean and spending time with family and friends there. __eou__ I do paddle bard when I'm off work, and I hope my new house is fully decorated so I don't need to miss too many summer days. __eou__ I tried paddle boarding once.  It was a disaster, fell right off.  When do you hope to move in? __eou__ In 6 weeks - fingers crossed. Yes, it takes time to learn, but great fun once you have. Do you go to family beaches ? __eou__ Yes, most of the time.  How about you? __eou__ No not really as I'm single. Its been so hot this year hasn't it... __eou__ Yes.  Really out of the norm.  The beach is a great place to meet other single people, have you had any luck? __eou__ Sadly, no, but I'm always on the look-out.....met lots of nice people and made friends though. I'm wondering about getting A/C installed, have you got it ?
I cannot wait till next week. We are going on a trip __eou__ Where to? __eou__ a location from my favourite book __eou__ Hey Cool what book? __eou__ Ender's game. Have you read it? __eou__ No but I saw the movie. What location are you tripping to?
I've heard of it, but I'm not clear on what it is they do. __eou__ Goodwill Industries provide many services. They offer employment placement, job training, and help others in community based programs find jobs. __eou__ That sounds like a great idea. Can you tell me more about Goodwill Industries? __eou__ Goodwill Industries help hire other who may lack education or face employment challenges. It helps them with work skills in that way. __eou__ Thats incredible! I am looking for a job at the moment. I recently finished up a six month contract as a broadway style dancer on a cruise ship. __eou__ How exciting! I've never been on a cruise. Where did you sail? __eou__ The cruise ship I worked on went to Jamacia, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. I would highly recommend cruising. __eou__ Maybe I'll look into some cruises in the Pacific. It's a good thing I live along the coast. __eou__ You should. What do you do for work? __eou__ I freelance, but when I can, I do volunteer work with an organization that donates tools to families and communities in Africa. __eou__ Thats really neat! How did you get involved with the volunteer work? __eou__ I shop at Goodwill a lot and connected with a group that volunteers there.
i prefer to be out in nature with my paintbrushes . trees are beautiful . __eou__ i really enjoy riding roller coasters outdoors ! it is one of my favorite things to do . __eou__ Roller coasters let you see the trees from a different perspective, when you are at the very top __eou__ So true! Plus you're able to see the world from a perspective you've never seen. You ever been to Disney World? __eou__ Only once, many years ago.  I was just a child. __eou__ My mother took me a lot as a kid. My dad left when I was only 5, so she took me there to get my mind off of it. __eou__ It's good to be able to lose yourself in an activity you love.  For me now, that is painting. __eou__ Agreed. I wish I was talented enough to paint. Do you ever paint any rollercoaster portraits? __eou__ No, I never have.  I can visualize one peeking out over the trees from a distance though.  Joins nature and civilization in a whimsical way. __eou__ I bet your portraits are amazing! I get as much of a thrill out of nature as I do rollercoasters. __eou__ I wish I lived near the mountains...so much more variety in nature. But I have learned to find the beauty of the plains. __eou__ You should look into Tennessee. The mountains there are majestic - plus they have plenty of amusement parks in the mountains for people like me. __eou__ Then I could visit Dollywood! __eou__ Also, Ashville, North Carolina is great. The Bitmore is a mansion located in Asheville that is begging for a portrait. Ha!
Having this new baby puppy around reminds me of how fragile life is. __eou__ Aw, that's cute, how old is he/she? __eou__ She's a few months old. I am Mary from Colorado. What is your name? __eou__ Jeff, actually in the UK so a good distance from you. ;o) I would love a dog, I think it might make me exercise more __eou__ Awww wow you are a distance a way lol. Exercise is great I enjoy hiking in the summer. What do you prefer? __eou__ Well, I don't really know what I prefer yet as I'm just starting a health drive - after giving up smoking recently __eou__ Oh wow, that is amazing. Congratulations on your continued health journey. Quiting anything can be really hard. __eou__ Thanks, I am rather proud as it was tough. What do you do in the winter though, if you hike in the summer only ? __eou__ You're very welcome. I like to go skiing in the mountains and relax at my cabin by a nice fire with a cup of hot cocoa. __eou__ OOoooo that sounds idyllic. I wonder if I could persuade my friends to go with me to do that? I go on holidays with them, but have never tried skiiing. __eou__ Yessss, persuade them to do so lol it is amazing. We only get one life so we might as well enjoy it, right? __eou__ Even if a leg or two gets broken - yes lol Can you take your puppy/dog with you to the lodge ? __eou__ Lol that is funny, yes I can take her and she enjoys it too. I buy the cute little coat and shoes for her to run around in the snow. __eou__ Oh I've seen those dog snow boots, they are adorable. I'm back to wanting a dog.......lol
I have never heard about them. What genre do they play? __eou__ They are pop punk rock __eou__ I am not great with genres to be honest, my little brother however is excellent at recognising them.  __eou__ They are similar to other pop punk bands such as blink 182 and Fall Out Boy, you should check them out! __eou__ I only know 1 song by blink 182, the one that goes nananana nananananana. Do you know?  __eou__ Yeah you might be talking about their song called All the Small Things __eou__ That's the one! I still sing it all the time with my parents and brother because we live together.  __eou__ haha same! My favorite song by them though is I Miss You. Really puts me in my feels __eou__ I'm sad to say that I do not know it. Do you have any other hobbies? I myself enjoy drawing. __eou__ I like drawing too! And watching lots of Netflix. What are your favorite things to draw? __eou__ Everyone loves to netflix, I watched mindhunter recently, you? I love playing soccer so I draw a lot of famous soccer players. __eou__ I recently watched this show called Haunted where people talk about their experiences with the paranormal. It's really interesting __eou__ Spooky! You're getting in the Halloween spirit aren't you? I am going to dress up as Asteria, you? __eou__ Yeah I love Halloween! I'm dressing up as Wednesday Addams. I'm so excited!
i am hoping to win the lottery this week __eou__ That would be a dream __eou__ If I do win, I may have to share the winnings with my Reddit family as I post there a lot. __eou__ Yeah, people do like impulse spending that comes with wagering money. __eou__ And honestly, that would be me. I'd have to buy a new car that was blue because I LOVE the color blue. __eou__ What kind of car would you get, what would be your dream car? __eou__ Probably an Aston Martin Vanquish because James Bond drives it. But instead of silver, I'd have to have a blue one. lol __eou__ That's a very nice car! Yeah, that's something I would get too. __eou__ I know it sounds crazy, but I'm obsessed with the color blue. Like, I only like Facebook because they use the color blue. __eou__ Haha, my shirt is kind of blue, i guess it is a really cool and versatile color. Reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog __eou__ Indeed it does! Makes me miss that old game. I guess his color was why I loved it so much! __eou__ Yeah! I love video games myself, i design them for a living.  __eou__ That sounds like a very difficult profession. A few people on Reddit I talk to design them as well. So you enjoy it? __eou__ Yeah, it's fun to create things and make them come to life. __eou__ I bet it is. Well I hope the next character you design wears a blue shirt. Ha!
I have a big test coming up, I wish time would hurry up so I can get it over with. __eou__ Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date?  __eou__ Next week! __eou__ Good luck in your studying! what is the test on? __eou__ It is a composite of the many skills required for putting on a show. __eou__ oh wow! that sounds interesting! last time I took a test I was almost late as my car broke down!    __eou__ Wow almost a bummer. I get confused between my studying for the test and for my show sometimes. __eou__ Yeah I got an old car from my dad that kept breaking down when I was in college! Are you singing in the show? __eou__ Why yes as well as dancing too. Do you have a better car now? __eou__ That sounds fun! I used to do a bit of musical performance when I was younger. I have the same car actually but I don't drive as often now. __eou__ Oh, I drive a lot to put on my show and the hamburgers I eat keep me going. Are you living in a city then with mass transit? __eou__ I also love hamburgers, I probably eat far too much lol. Yeah I use buses and trams to get around now mainly. __eou__ I live too far out of the city to use a bus. Isn't a hamburger a complete meal with tomato and lettuce? __eou__ Yeah, but you can add other ingredients too, my favourite is cheese and bacon. Do you like pizza? I just found a great place near me that does amazing pizzas.
yeah i got fired from work now i am looking for something new __eou__ i know the feeling i got fired in june . i'm looking for a job as well __eou__ Yeah it's tough, I really don't know what to do with myself right now. __eou__ What about working online? __eou__ Hmmm, I guess that could be something to do until another opportunity comes up. __eou__ Yes, it is a way to make a little money. __eou__ I guess something is better than nothing so I will have to look into it. __eou__ That's right!  __eou__ I think I just have to stay happy, I am sad for too long now.  __eou__ Yes, that is the most important thing.  __eou__ I just want something completely new and fresh. __eou__ i understand, what are you interested in? __eou__ Maybe I'll try to learn programming, it is a useful skill __eou__ Is there something in particular you are looking for?
Yes I love it too any kind of pasta, pizza, spaghetti gravy count me in! __eou__ So much people love it that its considered one of the most popular and copied cuisines in the world! __eou__ I spend so much cash going to a little Italian restaurant near my house.

I cook pasta a lot and my son loves to help me make homemade pizza. Do you cook Italian? __eou__ Yes, I love to cook!

I didn't get selected for a leadership training class at work.  I feel so let down by my work! __eou__ Is there another class you can apply for? __eou__ Yes, but I would have to go overseas. __eou__ I'm truly sorry to hear. I have a reddish-brown hair color so I always feel discriminated against when I'm passed over for others at work. __eou__ I'm sorry that you feel this way.  I am a heavy set women and feel the same way so I completely understand ya. __eou__ But all we can do is push on. I feel as if eventually they will realize they made a serious mistake. __eou__ yes most definitely.   __eou__ Like, I broke my arm in a skiing accident and thought I'd never be useful again. Now my arm is 100% and I feel like it never happened. __eou__  That is wonderful! I have MS and because of it have fallen several times and messed up my hips and back. __eou__ I hate hearing that. How long does it take you to recover from a fall? __eou__ I have been doing therapy for about 3 months now.  I am slowly coming back around. __eou__ Well I wish you a speedy recovery. I've heard using parallel bars for walking is the best form of PT in your situation. __eou__ yes, however, I am able to walk its just I am unsteady on my feet. __eou__ I understand. Balance has to be the most difficult thing to regain. __eou__ it is, but I am getting there.  Thank you for chatting with me today.

How old is your Mom?  __eou__ She's young- only 55, but she has MS and needs someone to take care of her. __eou__ That's horrible, my Mom is pushing 70 and went to Florida because that's where old people go. __eou__ Is she still in good health? __eou__ for the most part, she used to smoke and she has bad teeth that will eventually need to come out  __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that- dental work is so expensive in the US.

That is actually my favorite color, dark purple just feels so elite and royal! __eou__ Purple has been around a long time. The name was first used in English in 975 AD. __eou__ oh thats such a interesting fact, what is your favorite color/ __eou__ Orange is my favorite color. It reminds me of fall, specifically leaves changing and pumpkins. __eou__ oh, I love fall. It honestly has to be one of my favorite seasons ever. Only thing i dont like is that I can't swim. __eou__ Swimming is fun, but there are lots of things to do in the fall that are just as fun. __eou__ very true, my favorite is going to the pumpkin patch, or corn maze.

I can't stand the heat and humidity. What is yours? __eou__ I like swimming in summer but thats about it. I have to agree the humidity and heat is just horrible. __eou__ I just want it to be spring or fall all year round. I guess I should move somewhere more mild. __eou__ I think living near the coast would be nice, because of the breeze from the water.  __eou__ The coast could be nice. Maybe I could meet someone nice and my mom would stop bugging me.

How about you? __eou__ I do. Most would probably think I'm strange cause I know so much about the show, along with that I have orange and blue hair lol. __eou__ Lol that is funny. I can't live with out it honestly it's apart of my every day life. I live by a schedule to stay sane lol. __eou__ I would like to live more by a set schedule, but my 3-year-old makes that difficult lol __eou__ Lol I can really relate kids are adorable and they definitely keep you on your toes. __eou__ That they do. I'm enjoying my daughter and hoping to have one more child in the next couple of years. I dread their teenage years though. __eou__ I can say the teenage years are scary let me tell you __eou__ Oh I'm sure. They were scary enough for me when I was a teenager. Things are so different these days from 20 years ago! __eou__ Yes it is and it's so sad to say the least __eou__ That it is. We spent most of our time outdoors and now they all live in their phones moreso than anywhere else. Sigh.  __eou__ Ugh. I completely agree and just think Grey's Anatomy will be a thing of the past. __eou__ I dread the day when it is. Hopefully Netflix and other outlets like cable TV will keep it alive like they did some other shows like The Andy Griffith Show. __eou__ Yes good ole Netflix is the best. I really enjoyed our conversation. __eou__ I did as well. Thank you. __eou__ You're welcome
Really? I am not very familiar with Baltimore asides from the NFL team, the Ravens. What else can you tell me about Baltimore?  __eou__ Baltimore is in a very nice location.

when did the word first appear in history? __eou__ I'm not sure when the word itself first appeared, but pubs have been around in some form or another since ancient Roman times! __eou__ Well, I heard it goes back to the Romans, but unsure of the details. __eou__ I would think it would go back to the Greeks? __eou__ That would make sense, wouldn't it? Heck, I'm from Kansas and here we call them bars. __eou__ Yeah, we call them the same around here.  Pubs sound cooler though. __eou__ It does, I agree. I always thought it was British origin, for Public House allowed to sell liquor. __eou__ I didn't know that.  That makes alot of sense.  Either way I love going to them to have drink and meet people. __eou__ I'm the same, love them too. i once worked third shift (11pm - 7:30am) and there was a bar open serving breakfast. __eou__ That's convenient.    Did you know that the word breakfast comes from 'breaking a fast' meaning a fasting period in the middle of the night? __eou__ Wow, didn't know that. I just know I love eating eggs for breakfast. LOL __eou__ I eat 6 eggs every morning for breakfast.  Good source of protein. __eou__ That's a lot, good for you.  __eou__ Thanks!  Protein is essential for good health.  Do you try to eat healthy?

I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying __eou__ Yeah, I was not able to get any work done with it flying around. __eou__ My dogs four dogs are good at spotting them and trying to catch them flying around, it's pretty funny. __eou__ I bet.  That's a lot of dogs to keep fed, what kind of dogs are they? __eou__ The are all Golden Retrievers. What can I say? I love the breed. If I could spend all my time with my dogs I would. __eou__ That is a great breed.  How many bags of dog food to you go through a month? __eou__ Usually we go through about three huge bags. I give them human food as well, bad habit I know. __eou__ I bet they love it though.  Do they like eggs? __eou__ They do like eggs, but their favorite snack is peanut butter. __eou__ I love eggs, and breakfast in general.  Peanut butter is good too.

why do you run that long ? __eou__ i try to do triathlons . keeps me healthy . __eou__ Professionally or as an amateur  __eou__ As an amateur. I wish I could do triathlons in the winter too. Then I could snowboard. __eou__ Gosh, you must be fit! I'm afraid I should do more exercise, but I go to a lot of music gigs and socialise far too much __eou__ Going to gigs is a great way to spend your time. Maybe dance more and you could turn that into exercise. __eou__ Good plan, but as my favourite band is BonIver, dancing doesn __eou__ Bon Iver is my favorite too! Have you been to his Eaux Claire festival? __eou__ Sorry, accidentally sent before finished. Wow, no I didn't, my parents aren't very approving as they are Buddhist... __eou__ Threyhavada Buddhist or Varajahan? __eou__ Sorry, didn't catch that. They are Buddhist and raised me that way also __eou__ I was just curious which buddhist tradition. Most aren't very strict with regards to this sort of thing. __eou__ Well, it wasn't the music as such or the band, but the fact that there were lots of meat stalls there and they thought I mgiht seccumb __eou__ I'm sure that there would have been a lot of vegetarian options but I understand that parents worry.
i dont know much about sushi tell me more __eou__ Most sushi is made with raw seafood.  I like tuna. __eou__ Mmm, tuna! I'm a fan. __eou__ I saw this really good spicy tuna and shrimp recipie but i wish i could remember what site it was on.  __eou__ I've never tried making sushi at home, that sounds really fun! Have you ever done it? __eou__ I have not , but I do want to try. I have seen where you can have someone come teach you how to make it.  __eou__ That sounds like a great idea, I'd have to work it around my schedule (I'm a student). __eou__ oh , what are you studying to be ? I'm currently a Paramedic. __eou__ I'm studying social sciences :) __eou__ what do you like about social science? __eou__ It's interesting to see why people do the things that they do __eou__ That actually does sound like something neat. 
Nothing really, it's just a weekly thing for me, although I did just finish my accounting final project, so there is that. __eou__ You should celebrate with a drink! I find it hilarious that nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of making beer, wine and spirits. __eou__ I enjoy writing childrens books as a hobby and also enjoying drinking goes hand in hand. It makes me more creative lol. __eou__ That's when the creative juicy's flow lol. I sometimes do crazy things when I drink like a little late night riding on my mountain bike. __eou__ That sounds fun actually! I have to watch myself though, cause if someone gives me bad stimuli while drinking, I can have a bad mouth. __eou__ Ooooh yes I agree with you on that. The craziest thing when I drink I crave boiled eggs, so weird. __eou__ lol, really? I haven't heard that one before. I crave carbs it seems, like chips or crackers the most, for sure. __eou__ Yes, it is soooo weird. Chips sound so good right now lol I swear __eou__ Maybe I'll try to center my next book around chip cravings in some way or another! What's your favorite potato chip? __eou__ That would be a great one. Oooh that's a great question, at this moment tortilla chips with a hint of jalapeno  __eou__ I love pickled jalapenos. My favorite chip would be Flamin' Hot Cheetos or the cheese Pringles. __eou__ Yes pickled one are amazing and that would be another one of my favorites  __eou__ If you like tuna, I've found they go GREAT cut up and mixed with that! And I love them on top of nachos too of course. __eou__ Yes I love tuna and nachos are great as well. Do you like the mild, medium, or hot? __eou__ All of it! I love spicy food, so usually the hotter the better.
a lineman . . . that's ferocious ! __eou__ yes , my record is 128 , tackles that's ! any kids ? __eou__ Yes, I have 2 and I have to fight them for the halloween candy as its my passion lol __eou__ I love candy. __eou__ Oh gosh, whats not to like ey ? So, what do you do for a living ? __eou__ i work at an amazing candy shop . __eou__ No WAY !!!! My dream job, rather than what I actually do - a courier! __eou__ Really? That's interesting. What is your job? __eou__ It isn't as interesting as it sounds, a lot of driving and logging parcels in and finding houses and not being able to deliver. I prefer your job lol __eou__ Hahahaha.  That's pretty good.  The problem is this candy is very special.   __eou__ WHy so special ? __eou__ Children like candy to eat very much due to its taste. __eou__ Yes, but why is the candy so special ? __eou__ I guess because they taste really good
i do as well . i also like fashion a lot . __eou__ i currently have alot of kids __eou__ How many kids do you have? __eou__ 2- but that is a lot, trust me. __eou__ I wouldn't know, I don't have any kids.  Do you have time for yourself with 2 kids? __eou__ Not really. I used to follow my favorite band's tour, but not anymore. :( __eou__ That's too bad.  I would love to be a band's fashion coordinator.  It would be right up my alley. __eou__ That sounds like fun! I always assumed bands just put on whatever clothes they felt like. __eou__ That's what they want you to think, but the biggest bands have their outfit coordination down to a science. __eou__ Hmm ,never really thought about it that way. Why do you think that is? __eou__ I think it's just all about image and what they try to portray.  Are you influenced by the way band's look, or just their music? __eou__ Their look doesn't matter much to me- I'm all about the music! __eou__ Who's your favorite band? __eou__ Queens of the Stone Age- definitely!
That sounds awesome, could you tell me more about wave riding? __eou__ I can! When most people think of surfing they think of someone on the ocean, but suitable waves can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of standing waves or tidal bore. __eou__ I went surfing for the first time in Tofino, BC last summer. It was a little expensive for lessons, but worth it in the end.  __eou__ BC?  Is that British Columbia? __eou__ Yes, have you been around the West Coast at all?  __eou__ Not yet, but I've been to Canada.  How cold was the water when you were surfing there? __eou__ It was pretty chilly. I went in the beginning of June, so we had to have full bodysuits, boots included. Couldn't have been more than 12 degrees C. __eou__ Sweet.  I love to surf, but have only been on the Atlantic side, and once on a trip to Brazil.  Some killer waves there. __eou__ I actually want to move out of the country eventually. Brazil sounds amazing. I just can't seem to part with Canada just yet. Do you travel a lot? __eou__ Brazil is amazing.  Yeah, I travel as much as possible.  Any cool places in Canada to reccommend?
I don't think I have. Are you referring to like chicken broth? __eou__ Right like a liquid broth for chicken or beef or even vegetable.  It is actually quite tasty! __eou__ Have you ever made your own broth at home? It's pretty easy and a great way to use the leftovers from cooking. __eou__ I have! I have made it at my boyfriends house, but we did not do too well! What flavours do you like?\ __eou__ I really like to add a little anise in the broth but my wife doesn't __eou__ Perhaps some Vino with it? __eou__ For a beef broth I'll use a red wine, but I prefer a white wine for chicken or veggie stock __eou__ Napa wine is pretty good, but it is so juvenile compared to wine from Italy that goes back centuries! I mean, Napa was first made a city in 1872. __eou__ It may be a young city, but its old soil that has been used for centuries to grow high quality crops __eou__ I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural. __eou__ It's nice to get to experience the rich soil and wholesome smells. __eou__ that's true ! what do you do for work ? __eou__ I am a graduate student. What about you? __eou__ I'm old and I like Mushroom Ravioli
thanks but no , literally , i'm a big woman . i like eating out a lot . . . __eou__ ha ! ok . you ever try cooking at home ? it can be good and healthy . __eou__ I know that's true. But I don't think I got the time for it. Plus I like to try different food __eou__ There's some great cookbooks for cooking a meal in less than 15 minutes! __eou__ Yeah...if you have all the ingredients they want you to have...Haha! There is always 1 thing that's missing im my fridge __eou__ True, although I used some of the services that deliver the ingredients to you for a specific meal, it's really useful __eou__ Hmm, I never thought about that! Do you cook at home a lot?  __eou__ All the time, it's so much healthier and much cheaper. With some planning you can have a good variety too __eou__ That's true! What type of job do you do?  __eou__ I'm retired, so I guess that helps, means I have plenty of spare time to cook! __eou__ Oh that's why! I guess I have to wait quite a while to reach that time of my life...You must be very relaxed! __eou__ I am indeed. What do you do? __eou__ I work a full time job and I have 2 kids. So much on my plate! __eou__ You must be so busy! I never had children, how old are yours?
Nope, completely unfamiliar.  Tell me about it please. __eou__ Well, they are a pop punk band, and they actually borrowed their name from another band, New Found Glory, who had a song title with that name! __eou__ I think I heard of New Found Glory, but not super familiar with them. I started doing work online not long ago. Loving it so far! __eou__ That is amazing I love online work and ordering food online lol. Guilty pleasure is Mcdonalds __eou__ I love McDonald's also. Me and my family do lots of shopping online but making money online is new territory for us. __eou__ I think you will really enjoy it. Do you have a big family? __eou__ Nah, just a three person household right now and the family I was born with isn't really large either.  __eou__ Oh ok I have a really big family.The youngest of eight and my husband I have three kids and twins are baking in the oven lol. __eou__ Wow! That sounds more like a huge family lol. Congrats on the upcoming twins! My wife and I plan to have at least one more, two tops. __eou__ Thank you, we're really excited and decided to wait to find out what we're having. Kids are amazing aren't they. __eou__ Yes they are. It's fun seeing some of your own traits in them and then understanding why your parents yelled at you so much lol. __eou__ Omg, it's fun and nerve wrecking at times lol. Now I understand oh so well. __eou__ That's why a side job is so important too, to support them more easily lol. __eou__ Side JOBS lol woooh they require a lot. As parents we want to make sure they have the best life possible.
My aunt died. __eou__ I am sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now? __eou__ Pretty bummed out.  She was my mom's sister and best friend. __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . when did she pass ? __eou__ 4 days ago.  She was visiting from the states too when she passed. __eou__ Hopefully your mom hasn't passed away, and you just haven't visited her in a while. __eou__ No, my mom is still alive and well.  She is taking it pretty hard though.   __eou__ i bet . be patient though . i am sure this is hard enough for her . __eou__ Yeah, how about you?  Are your parents still alive? __eou__ they are . are your parents still living ? __eou__ My mom is, but my dad passed away 10 years ago. __eou__ I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy. __eou__ Yeah, he is.  He always was a heavy drinker though. __eou__ Some drunks are funny, and some are unfortunately annoying as hell.
we play bingo , every wednesday . bubble gum ? haha , that is pink __eou__ he is always telling me that i've a pink tint to my hair __eou__ you should dye it pink one day to mess with him. __eou__ Great idea! Or dye his pink when he's sleeping __eou__ Even better!  Is he a deep sleeper? __eou__ Yeah, sleeps like a log. Would easily be able to pull it off. Maybe cut a mohawk in whilst I'm at it __eou__ Perfect.  My husband would be so mad if I did something like that.  But it would be worth it __eou__ Can they take a joke. Mine can, but I don't think it would be good for his job! __eou__ Yeah, all of my family is really close.  They'd be able to handle a good prank.
frenchie smenchie! do they have any redeeming qualities at all?? __eou__ lol. It is a small breed of domestic dog __eou__ lol. im only kidding i actually own a french bulldog, they have sill personalities. __eou__ Oh that's cool. Do you enjoy long walks with him? may be on the beach? I love that __eou__ i do like going on walks with him, but i haven't had a chance to take him to the beach . I'm sure he __eou__ Do you live anywhere near the beach? __eou__ i live in Florida, we just havent had the chance to go together . I just moved. __eou__ Florida got the best beaches. You definitely need to try that! I love Florida! __eou__ i actually get nervous about losing something on the beach, I once Lost a diamond at a debutante ball. i need to get a medal detector __eou__ Woh! That's not fun! Hope you won't lose your dog! He must be more precious than diamond! __eou__ defintley he's my little best friend. do you have any pets? __eou__ No, I don't. My husband has allergies! He will not survive around pets! __eou__ maybe a fish ? __eou__ Fish is too much work and I hate the idea that sometimes they die for no reason!

How long have you done that? __eou__ it's been about 2 years now or more. when i got my cat speckles i would sit by the window with him for hours on end sometimes. Hows your garden? __eou__ My garden is just lovely but this rain has been a real damper on it. __eou__  I understand. I don't like bad weather either.

It was more of a hobby, are you still swimming? __eou__ Yes, I try and swim at the local YMCA at least once a week. It is very relaxing.  __eou__ That sounds super relaxing. Swimming is nice though i'd go more often, if only my cat liked it as well haha.

I work as a freight driver and find that loads of us have them..... __eou__ I sell insurance, so I get to work from home a lot. I am a homebody that likes to sit on the couch and watch TV. __eou__ Have your employers been accepting of your tats, when they do see you at an office ?  __eou__ Oh yes, but I do cover them up as much as I can when I go into the office. Working at home helps me with that situation also. __eou__ Shame to cover them, luckily I don't have to. WHy Japanese influenced ? __eou__ I love the artwork and creativity. __eou__ It is very unique and beautiful for sure. As a woman I appreciate that style ! __eou__ What are your tattoos of, origin or reasons? __eou__ Well, my first one was the hand print of my daughter as a baby, then I had three more children so had to add them. One led to another.... __eou__ I want to add one for my son soon, I love the silhouette ones of mother and child. __eou__ Well if you've got a full body suit , you might be out of space lol At 43 my child birthing days are over, luckily.... __eou__ I saved one spot in the full body suit just for this occasion. It's the only spot open.
That's interesting. I didn't know that is what it's called.

About 5 years ago, I went to a swimming pool. In the showers, some kids made fun of my body. I felt bad about it. __eou__ kids can be so hurtful, be happy about who you are! __eou__ Thanks! I'm getting over it. I wish I've been to more places! Specially to a city __eou__ You have to stay strong I get teased all the time about my occupation as a short order cook at a local diner. __eou__ Yeah! Everyone has their own story! What's there to tease about what you're doing! __eou__ I guess I am not making as much as my other friends or associates __eou__ I'm the same! __eou__ It's ok I learn to destress from it all. Like this past summer i hiked the appalachian trail it was amazing. __eou__ Oh cool! How long was it? Did you go by yourself? __eou__ It took me a while to do so but I went about 3 years ago and I would love to go back.  __eou__ That sounds like a great idea for me. Specially here in Ohio, you can find many natural trails __eou__ That is amazing. What do you do for fun? __eou__ I live in a rural small town in Ohio.

i was born and raised in ga and i like all types of music __eou__ thank you for your patience i like make up and wearing nice clothes . __eou__ I usually dress casually, even at the restaurant I waitress at. __eou__ Really, do you serve customers by supplying them with food and drink as requested? __eou__ That I do. They don't serve alcoholic drinks where I work, but I serve all the others! Sometimes large families also. __eou__ I see, you have a very important role in a restaurant. I hope you are paid well for it! __eou__ Well you know, most of my income I get from tips. I do pretty well with those, fortunately. How is your work? __eou__ it sort of pays well , but as long as i can pay the bills i'm happy . __eou__ I hear that. Having a side job or two can always help also. Especially if you can work from anywhere and do as little or as much as you want. __eou__ Yeah, definitely. I'm always looking for ways to make more money. __eou__ Most of us have to these days, especially with the way the economy's been for years. __eou__ Yea. I'm always worried that a recession could hit and last a year or more! Which means an overcrowded job search field. __eou__ Yeah for sure, like in 2008. What are some of your favorite clothes or shoes to wear? __eou__ new balance . they really support my feet .
I trust my family, they have never let me down __eou__ Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that. __eou__ I know, a lot of my friends have told me that __eou__ How many siblings do you have? __eou__ I only have one older brother! He is almost 2 years older than me so we are close __eou__ Cool, my sisterand I get along pretty well. __eou__ That's awesome!

what kind of animals do you have __eou__ i moved a little ways from home but we have horses chicken pigs etc __eou__ I do not have many friends so I spend a lot of time with my 2 dogs and cat. __eou__ I have 4 cats and planning to get a puppy in a few months. Have you had your pets since they were small? __eou__ I have one of the dogs since I was 16. I rescued the other dog and cat after I finished college. __eou__ Rescues are always great! I have one rescue cat __eou__ Oh yes, they are my little friends and we live in our own little fantasy world. Just us. Haha. __eou__ Sounds cozy. I usually prefer to hang out with animals over people as well. :) Do the dogs and cat get along well? __eou__ Oh, they are best friends. I made sure when I adopted them they were okay around each other. My other dog eventually warmed up to them. __eou__ I am a little worried because my cats are pretty content with no other animals around. They've never been around dogs, so not sure how they'll react to a puppy __eou__ I think they will eventually warm up to them. You may have to get 2 dogs so they can play with each other and won't bother the cats. __eou__ Oh man. I haven't had a dog since I was a teenager, so I'm nervous enough about getting one. Cats seem easier. __eou__ I agree cats are so much easier, especially when it comes to potty training them. I don't miss that nightmare at all. __eou__ That's what I really dread. Mid-night wake ups to go out
its okay i have gotten through it . my days are better except for my terrible allergies lol __eou__ oh ? what kind of allergies do you have ? __eou__ cats __eou__ Oh!

I missed the sale on wool socks. They are pretty pricey. __eou__ Are those the 20 dollar socks why are they so expensive?  __eou__ They are real wool and great quality. They are pricey but last a long time. __eou__ i bet you can make nice things from their wool,it could give some fittings __eou__ It would probably be cheaper to make it yourself too. __eou__ Yeah I didn't think about that,its good you suggested that, Could see some benefit there.. __eou__ Do you own any wool items? __eou__ quite a few pairs ,my shirts a made of wool, how about you ? __eou__ I have some wool coats and gloves. I work as a cab driver and it can get quite chilly.  __eou__ Interesting!That sounds like it could be pretty uncomfortable to have to wear every day? __eou__ It's more uncomfortable to be cold! __eou__ i suppose that's a plus if you like feeling cozy ! Neither are pretty comfortable,but one just had to cope. __eou__ Exactly. I am a student taking courses online so hopefully I will have a new job once those are complete. __eou__ online classes are great . i took a few of them in the past !Saves you some stress

I was worried you meant something harder, and was going to suggest you get a cat for company :p __eou__ i have cats, 3 of them. one of them is a polydactyl and has extra thumbs __eou__ CUTE!  I love those extra thumbs.  I only have one cat, my roommate won't allow more.  She's a tabby. __eou__ tabbys are cool , maybe you should get rid of the roommate __eou__ But then my cat would need a job so we could make the rent :p

But I don't think it matches with my skin color! __eou__ Talking to you inspires me to try something totally different like maybe coloring my hair green in the future before I start working full time! __eou__ hahaha! I think you should try that! Enjoy that time out of work to the fullest!

I am thinking about dressing up as a bat to match my babies Dracula theme! __eou__ Aww, that is a great idea. I am still thinking about this year. There are so many ideas that I love. Any suggestons? __eou__ Not really, there are cute ideas on the internet. I would try looking there __eou__ That is a great idea.

I do love Cheetos, though.   __eou__ Cheetos are good!  I'm not a big fan of vegetables.  If I had to choose, I would say green beans are my favorite.   __eou__ I like green beans, too.  Especially when they're just picked.  How do you like to cook them? __eou__ I like them best baked or using the air fryer.  Have you every used an air fryer?  __eou__ No, but I'm interested in them.  Are they really healthier than deep frying? __eou__ I think the food tastes just as good if not better.

What ages represent an elementary school? __eou__ In the United States, for example, elementary students are usually between 6 to 12, but sometimes 6 to 10 and 6 to 14. __eou__ That's interesting. In my school district, 14-year-olds would be in high school. I do like the idea of having a broader mixture of ages, though. __eou__ I remember school details here cause it was when I got my start playing football. I play now for the Philadelphia Eagles, my second season. __eou__ Woah. Really? I grew up outside Philadelphia, in Cherry Hill, so you guys are still my home team! __eou__ Wow, small world!

Would you like to get into coaching or something else? __eou__ As of now I can't see myself coaching. Would love to save up, start a family, and just travel the world with them. See lots of countries while we're young. __eou__ Yeah, that sounds cool. Get yourself a good financial advisor now, while you're young. __eou__ You know, that would be a good idea. I feel I'm pretty frugal, but it's easy to get off track. I'll do that. Thank you for real.

What's your favorite food? __eou__ Im pretty simple. Juicy steak, mashed garlic potatoes and salad. If the steak is cooked right it doesnt need any sauce or toppings. __eou__ A good steak is the best.  I like mine medium, you? __eou__ my favorite is medium rare. warm red center. So juicy and flavorful __eou__ I think you may have just helped me figure out dinner tonight!

You know? __eou__ Hmm...that does sound interesting. I'm more interested in taking photos of the world. __eou__ WOW that sound neat, where have you been that you have taken pictures of the world? __eou__ Well...I haven't traveled...yet. I do take a lot of photos in the forest near my house.  __eou__ Does the forest have multiple seasons so you can capture the same place with different colors? __eou__ It does! I live in an area that experiences all four seasons.  __eou__ very nice ! do you have ample time to take photographs ? __eou__ I do! I'm trying to establish myself as a freelancing.

I have heard of freshwater pearls, so I'm not so surprised.  How many kinds are there? __eou__ I am not sure as to the number but I do know that some crustaceans that are enjoyed by diners are lobster, shrimp, and crabs. __eou__ It's been so long since I've had a good seafood boil. At the bar, we just have the cocktail shrimp. __eou__ Some people are allergic to seafood __eou__ I know, it's so unfortunate! I couldn't imagine life without crab legs and mussels. __eou__ I don’t think i could eat something with legs everywhere! __eou__ Are you a vegetarian? __eou__ No i eat animals, but not ones that come out of the sea... four legs is ok but eight? __eou__ Haha! I totally understand. What's your favorite dish? __eou__ I like pizza, but not with shellfish on, it brings me out in a rash!

Are you a vegetarian? __eou__ I'm not, I just like experimenting with different food. If it's good, I'll eat it! __eou__ An omnivore! What other dishes have you experimented with? __eou__ I made some Mediterranean steak over couscous and it was AMAZING. I used a meal kit! 
I actually live in a Victorian Home! They're one of my favorite architecture. __eou__ Oh that would be so beautiful!  I read that the era followed the Georgian period and it's later half overlaps with the first part of the "Belle Epoque" era of continental Europe __eou__ Oh that whole era was beautiful! The architecture, the theater, the writings. It was a very romantic period. __eou__ That's true. The Victorian Period is when there was romanticism and mysticism to the concepts of social values, religion and arts. Quite different from the Georgian period. __eou__ If you had to choose which one would you prefer to live in?
Yes, what is the landmass of the city proper? __eou__ It depends upon definition.    Manhattan is bounded by Manhattan Island __eou__ You really know your stuff.  How long have you lived here? __eou__ For about 10 years. I love the fast pace. The New York Minute is for real. __eou__ It's all new to me, especially having to cram all my stuff into such a tiny living space __eou__ What is the square footage? __eou__ 450 square feet--I'm not used to it but I know space comes at a premium around here. __eou__ Yeah, that's about what you can expect. __eou__ Where are you from originally? __eou__ Texas.  It was in the 90's today. __eou__ Yikes.  I hate hot weather.  What brought you to New York? __eou__ The weather. It's the same temperature and humidity everyday.  __eou__ Well...not year round though! __eou__ Oh you know what I mean.
No, I've never heard of them. __eou__ It is an international orgnaization that helps further the barbershop harmony music through education and performances __eou__ Interesting. Do they have any songs where they rap too? I like rap __eou__ I don't really like rap. No, the organization doesn't promote or work with rap music. What songs do you like? __eou__ Lots of different songs, but mainly babershop and rap. You? __eou__ I prefer oldies myself. Rap is too new for me.  __eou__ Oldies is fun to listen to when I'm sleeping or napping. __eou__ I can't listen to music while I'm napping or sleeping. I like it really quiet. But put on oldies and I start dancing! __eou__ How fun! Do you have a favorite dance? __eou__ I can do the twist. It helps my old body stay young.  __eou__ I've heard dancing  is a good workout! Good cardio __eou__ Yes! Not only is it good cardio but it is also good for your mental state. Makes you happy and giggly.  __eou__ Music and dancing are great for the soul and body!

yea they had like cotton and tabacco plantations __eou__ Cotton and tea are commonly grown crops __eou__ I grew up on a huge farm most of my childhood years and we focused on cotton and corn mostly. __eou__ I was in college before I learned that the corn you see when you drive through country areas is mostly for animal feed! I always thought it was normal corn __eou__ That's right, and the crows and some other animals really think it's for them lol. As busy as farm life was, I always loved reading and found time for it. __eou__ I fantasize about moving to the country sometimes. I've only ever lived in the city. It would be a great way to grow up. __eou__ I love living in the country! I always get worried and uneasy when traveling to a large city like Atlanta. __eou__ Halloween's better in the city, though. More trick-or-treating density. I had a huge sweet tooth as a kid and would map out my route like a general. __eou__ I actually live in a small city these days, population a little over 100,000. Certain parts have tons of trick or treaters. __eou__ Aw, cool. I love Halloween. It's my favorite holiday. Lots of candy and no baggage :D __eou__ Mine is Christmas, especially for all the lights and because it's usually colder weather by then.
that sounds great . i like to go to disney world to show off my outfits . __eou__ i love watching disney movies ! __eou__ I really like the princess' designs, what do you like about them? __eou__ I love the music and singing along. __eou__ The music is so good.

Do you have a favourite song? __eou__ My favorite Disney song is Kiss the Girl from the Little Mermaid. __eou__ Haha that's a classic. Ursula was a great villain in that movie. __eou__ Definitely! I played her in a show once.  __eou__ Oh man I'm so jealous! Dressing up like that must have been so much fun. __eou__ It was, and performing Poor Unfortunate Souls was a blast. I got to sing it and shake it. __eou__ Another contender for the best song. __eou__ Along with the entire Moana soundtrack!

I love New York __eou__ i like new york, well atleast what i have seen in movies and tv. __eou__ You have to visit someday! I've been three times, it's like no other city out there. __eou__ my dad was a preacher and his church group went once, but i never did. what is your favorite part of new york? __eou__ That's a tough one! Either Manhattan or Brooklyn __eou__ if i were to visit where would you suggest i should go see? __eou__ I would suggest Manhattan to see Times Square as a must see. Other than that it really depends on what you like, theres something for everyone __eou__ it sounds like such an exciting place to be ,maybe i will go in the new year __eou__ That would be a great time to go! They really celebrate it big up there. It'd be a lot of fun __eou__ so, what is you favorite movie? __eou__ Titanic! And yours?
Nothing really, it's just a weekly thing for me, although I did just finish my accounting final project, so there is that. __eou__ You should celebrate with a drink!

Do you have a job right now? __eou__ I do. I work in accounting at a small family owned company. It's great!  __eou__  I can't wait until I graduate and can start working. I'm in between jobs right now, so I just kind of sit around. What movie are you watching? __eou__ Stuber! Have you seen it? It is pretty hilarious!  __eou__ No!  I don't even know what it is about, can you tell me? __eou__ Cop goes after drug dealer. He had eye surgery and can't drive so he has to hire an UBER driver that helps him through everything.  __eou__ Sounds like fun.  I'm binge watching The Magicians, I love magic stuff.  But I always need something new to watch! __eou__ I have a few of those shows that I binge watch. Netflix is my friend!  __eou__ I love netiflix. I need to get a job so I can keep using it, hahaha! __eou__ Work is a little overrated. It really cuts into my Netflix time :)
I like doing word puzzles and Sudoku mostly __eou__ Some of the Sudoku puzzles are hard, the 9x9 grid ones, but they are fun to do. __eou__ Yes, They really are! I play football too __eou__ That's cool! I am terrible at sports but I admire people who are good that them. __eou__ I've been playing it since high school. Now I play in college __eou__ Wow, you must be really good then.  My husband played high school football too but stopped after a couple of really bad concussions. __eou__ oh that's too bad! Do you do a job? __eou__ I'm a teacher.  How about you? __eou__ I'm doing an internship and attending second year in college __eou__ What field is your internship in? __eou__ Engineering! I like it so far __eou__ That's a challenging field of work--what type of engineering are you interested in? __eou__ I'm thinking about civil engineering, more onto the construction __eou__ That's an interesting choice!  Good for you. Must be hard to balance your studies with football.
Hello, yesterday was my birthday and my wife completely forgot! __eou__ It's alright maybe it's a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday __eou__ She could have at least said 'Happy Birthday' or SOMETHING. I can wait for the gift! __eou__ That is true. Maybe she just honestly forgot. I wouldn't take it personal though. She has alot on her right now with the death of her mother. __eou__ That's true. I want to be empathetic, but she's really hard to read these days. __eou__ I know this is a difficult time for both of you. Her grieving and you trying your best to shoulder alot of things she use to do. __eou__ I wish I could just get into her head and figure out exactly what she needs from me. __eou__ take care and spend time with her . we could all be gone tomorrow . __eou__ No kidding. Forget my birthday, I might just set up a nice evening for her. __eou__ You're so kind she will love that.

Happy wife, happy life, right? __eou__ exactly , i would have to agree with you . cherish every moment . __eou__ Speaking of which, I just got a message from her. You might be right about her trying to surprise me later. __eou__ I knew it wasnt like her to forget! She loves you so! Yall are the cutest couple
I just can't stand it anymore. My partner nags almost about every detail of our relationship. Just yesterday, she criticized my taste for clothing __eou__ That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel? __eou__ I have. She is not very appreciative of my hobbies.  __eou__ That’s a shame, what are your hobbies? __eou__ I enjoy rock collecting and have recently developed a knack for macaroni art __eou__ Macaroni art is my favourite type of art!

I love Mexico! What is your favorite part? __eou__ I like the part that closely borders the USA the most.  __eou__ Yeah? Did you know the capital city is the oldest capital in the Americas, and was first built by the Aztecs in 1325. __eou__ I didn't know that! Do you have any other facts about Mexico? __eou__ Of course! Mexico is the 11th most populated country in the world with around 117 million people. I'v travelled there quite a bit so picked up some things! __eou__ What is your favorite food from Mexico? __eou__ Definitely enchiladas. How about you? __eou__ I love them...but they give me gas! It's pretty bad.  __eou__ That isn't Ideal, but my mother makes ones so good it'd be worth it! __eou__ Enchiladas for the win! Gas never hurts anyone. Sometimes I even use my armpits to make fart noises. I can play the National Anthem with my pits.  __eou__ That's Impressive! My musical talent expands to playing the triangle, It's harder than it looks to be honest. __eou__ Hey, we all need our talents!

Something like that? __eou__ Yeah that kind of thing. With the lapel and everything. __eou__ Nice! They look sharp, but they're also really cozy. They feel like you're wearing a bathrobe everywhere lol __eou__ Yeah, it's so soft. Once you get over the cold, winter is a great season.  __eou__ We're waiting for the first snow here. Hoping it holds off until I get home __eou__ Nothing beats when it first sets and you've got that crisp layer on top, before everyone starts walking in it. __eou__ I'm a grown adult and I still get a thrill at making fresh tracks in snow. It's like getting first crack at the new peanut butter jar. __eou__ It just makes getting home and having a nice hot dinner so much better too. __eou__ Hot stuff, though. Chili, soup... __eou__ Meat. __eou__ right , sorry i forgot the meat part .

I bring my dolly, though. __eou__ I've been considering picking up martial arts to protect myself when I go to the store.  __eou__ That sounds fun! I would like to practice outside. __eou__ Yeah...I've been looking for some krav maga classes near my house. I'm not sure if they train outside or inside though.  __eou__ I don't know what krav maga is. It sounds really fun, though. __eou__ Krav maga is a form of martial arts! It is meant specifically to help people with self-defense. Might help you more than your dolly.  __eou__ thanks i will have to look into it .
our lord and saviour will help us! he will guide us all to paradise, i have faith ! __eou__ wow thats very faithful of you __eou__ Thank you, Don't you think the same? __eou__ Yes, I do believe that everyone has a purpose.  I once fell up an entire flight of stairs with only a bruise or two, so I definitely have faith __eou__ Oh, that relatively small injury, Jesus always saves us with the least injury possible   __eou__ Yes.  What type of music do you like to listen to?
I didn't know that every letter gets used in a crossword! That's cool. How often do you do crossword puzzles? __eou__ I try and do at least one a week. The cryptic crosswords have each clue as a word puzzle in and of itself so it can take a while to solve them. __eou__ My dad loved cryptic crosswords!  I remember finding them way too hard when I was younger--maybe I should try them again, __eou__ Definitely! You'll get addicted. It's like a workout for your brain! __eou__ I'll check them out.  I'd rather do those than anything math related, that's for sure! __eou__ I can't argue with that! I was never a huge fan of math. __eou__ I really hated math when I was in school--English was always my favorite. __eou__ My favorite class in school was always art. I love painting, drawing, and I would even crochet during my other classes. __eou__ That's awesome! Hey, speaking of painting, did you know it's Bob Ross' birthday today?  __eou__ I didn't know that! I loved watching his show when I was younger. So serene! __eou__ He was a truly exceptional human being.  His show was almost like engaging in meditation (and I'm not even artistic--I can't draw at all!). __eou__ I probably should have followed along with the show, but I just loved watching. 'Happy little trees' made for a good nap time. __eou__ Indeed. That and Mr. Rogers.  I wish he was still around. __eou__ I agree! I miss Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. I still sing the song from time to time.
I am confident about my new job, and I can not wait to get started! __eou__ Awesome, what field do you work in? __eou__ Horse racing!

I even bet on which ones i think will win! __eou__ that's crazy , did you bet on them or race yourself ? __eou__ No no I cant race them. I am a tall and wide person. lol but I love trying to figure out who I think will win __eou__ oh its nice so can u please tell about something crispy __eou__ Crispy? I love crispy chicken fingers __eou__ i just want to know about your horse racing crispy experience __eou__ Well I bet alot. over 90,000 trifecta bets this year. I have won over $50,000 on one horse race alone. Definitely one of my biggest bets.  __eou__ Wow! one thousand is alot. Welldone buddy, enjoy your winning
I worked really hard for a promotion at work and I ended up not getting it. __eou__ That is a shame! I'm sorry to hear that. If you really like you job then just keep working hard. I am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon. __eou__ It is okay. I will find another job. __eou__ If you feel ready for a promotion then, yeah, time to look further afield then. I am going to start looking when both my kids are at school. __eou__ How is your job market? I live in New York so mine is pretty good and leaves me some room for a career switch __eou__ NOt great, I'm very rural and without travelling there is little to go for that is well paid.  __eou__ Do you like to travel? __eou__ NO, not really, and certainly not in terms of commuting. Well, we will see what turns up. Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ I enjoy traveling to different countries. I am going to visit my best friend in Japan soon __eou__ AH ok, thats why you asked about travelling. Japan sounds fascinating, have you been before ? __eou__ No, this is my first time, __eou__ They are very very good at something I have an interest in , Robotics, world leaders __eou__ That is fascinating. Robotics is an intersting field __eou__ Yes it certainly is, and definitely nothing career related around my way in this field. Ah well...

I reside on a ranch, so naturally a love of the outdoors comes natural. __eou__ i like to play with my pet then go to zoo my favorite animal is zebra __eou__ I love animals too! I have a dog and if I were to pick a favorite animal it would be polar bear or penguin. __eou__ okay nice. __eou__ I love zebras also. There is a farm near me that has a zebra that always comes to the fence for petting when it sees me. __eou__ do you know i am a girl  __eou__ I didn't know that. I am a male.  __eou__ i know  __eou__ How did you know? __eou__ just i guessed it __eou__ Good guess! This chat has me wanting to go to the zoo. I have not been in a long time.

How many boys/girls so you have __eou__ 9 girls 2 boys. I need a vacation. __eou__ Haha yea I imagine! Where would you go __eou__ somewhere cold, then the kids wouldnt want to come with, and that'd be perfect. __eou__ Maybe the Northwest, its pretty chilly

7 years is a long time , i'm not very satisfy with my job . __eou__ where do you work at __eou__ Oh its not very interesting, I prefer to not think about it outside of the time they pay me. __eou__ Have you ever thought about looking for something that you would enjoy more?  __eou__ Do you enjoy your job? __eou__ Yes. it's a good time.  __eou__ Do you have any hobbies and interests? __eou__ I could sit on a beach all day.  __eou__ I’d like that too, as long as i could keep up with what was going on in the world. __eou__ There are always ways to keep in touch with the world.  __eou__ Do you enjoy listening to the news? __eou__ Occasionally. I like to read fun reads instead of depressing news.  __eou__ Yes the news can be a bit depressing, what is your favourite thing to read? __eou__ I love non fictional readings of historical events.  __eou__ What is your favourite book?
I was excited that my neighbor came to my door __eou__ Good, How long haven't you talk to each other? __eou__ it's been a while, last time i talked to them was in my college history class three years ago. __eou__ Oh cool, I miss college :) were you a history major? __eou__ yes! i now teach at a middle school. __eou__ That's impressive! How long have you been teaching? __eou__ for over an year, really fun! __eou__ I bet it's really rewarding :) must take a lot of patience though __eou__ It does! but its worth it to teach youth about the past. __eou__ Absolutely, you have to know history to understand context of the present __eou__ "If not taught right the first time, history will only repeat itself" __eou__ Very true - and a good teacher can really make or break that experience __eou__ i agree, my teachers were always fun and made it a experience to never forget. __eou__ Lucky! I've had some really amazing teachers, and some where I learned a lot about how not to teach, haha
Oh I volunteer at a nursing home! It's very important to take care of the elderly. __eou__ Oh cool! I thinks it's good they've started smaller nursing homes, gives more individual care __eou__ Absolutely. I've heard horror stories from the larger ones. It's terrible what some people do. __eou__ It is sad.  What made you decide to volunteer at nursing homes? __eou__ My dad recommended it after my grandma was in one. I just love being able to help, and cheering them up! __eou__ That is so sweet, you are such a good person.  I am not volunteering anywhere right now, I'm to busy at my job as a cartographer for google maps. __eou__ Wow! How did you get that job? It sounds fun! __eou__ I kind of lucked into it at the beginning, I think it's a lot harder now.  What do you do when you aren't volunteering? __eou__ I mostly just spend time with my family. My dad passed a few months ago. __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that.  What is your favorite memory with him? __eou__ When I was little, we would go to a cut your own Christmas tree farm. It was the best! __eou__ That is such a nice memory.  Are you doing ok right now?   __eou__ Oh yes, we're getting through it all together. Thank you :) __eou__ Very good, I'm glad you have a good support network.  My family all gets together and my brother starts hollering for us to all arm wrestle...so there's that LOL
i'm so sorry to hear that did you call her ? __eou__ she's dead we were watching thomas the train and then she was gone __eou__ Jesus. That's horrible. How are you coping? __eou__ I'm still kind of numb. It feels unreal. __eou__ Yeah. It will for a while. Plus everybody copes differently.  There's no "right" way to do it, no matter what people say. __eou__ Well at least she's in a better place. I'm just going to miss her. __eou__ Do you have anyone close to you to lean on for support? __eou__ I really don't feel like reaching out. I just want to curl up with some ice cream and be alone for a while. __eou__ You know what, that's totally ok. You have to look after yourself. __eou__ Do you have a favorite movie to watch when you're sad? __eou__ I think it really depends on the situation--sometimes I want something that will help me cry it out while other times something that will cheer me up is better. __eou__ My go-to was Thomas the Train, but that's definitely out the window now. __eou__ oh man...I'm sorry.  I like to go surfing to take my mind off of things but maybe that's not for you. __eou__ If only I lived near the beach. I would actually love that.
They are! Do you know if they are any good at flying? __eou__ I don't know how well they can fly - I do know that they nest in tree hollows and lay white eggs  __eou__ how big do they grow to be? __eou__ They can grow to be much larger than an inch __eou__ Wow. That's not too big at all. I didn't study about parrots at Stanford.  __eou__ I didn't study about parrots at Stanford either. I love parrot too much and my family is disappointed in me __eou__ Why are they disappointed? Does the parrot make too much noise? __eou__ Well they probably had high hopes of my interest being in other things. But I love PARROT too much for them. __eou__ Well, I love pizza, but it's not the focal point of my life. You can have other interests, particularly when it comes towards your career.  __eou__ That's so true. My parrot Todd is really a blessing and a curse that way. You must love Parrot too. __eou__ I don't love parrots. I don't really like birds all that much. I prefer dogs.  __eou__ I once asked my parrot to mediate an argument between myself and a dog. Dogs are lovely, I agree. __eou__ Did it work? __eou__ Let's just say it was a "linguistically functional" event, but Todd was not able to resolve the issue.

Is Karate an offensive or defensive art? __eou__ Not sure, but I do know that full contact karate comes in different formats __eou__ Wow what formats __eou__ Goju-ryu, which is a lot like jujistu. Vicious counter-strikes and almost dance-like defenses. Then there __eou__ I like dancing and karate. I was in karate when i was younger. How about you? __eou__ I actually got into it fairly late. I was more into track and rowing in high school. What kind of dancing do you do? __eou__ i like 2 step. Rowing how many people are on a team? __eou__ When I rowed in high school, it was eight people to a boat. Not sure if college or other levels are different __eou__ I have seen it on TV before.

What's your jam? __eou__ Your a good person. My family and I like to walk and pick up trash. It is crazy how much there is when you start looking for it.  __eou__ Definitely, but it's getting better.

my friend won the lottery whcih is awesome __eou__ That's great! How much did they win? __eou__ $500.  that's a big win in my book. lol. __eou__ no kidding! I've never won anything more than another lottery ticket, haha __eou__ right.  the most i have ever won is another ticket.  i am not lucky when it comes to gambling. __eou__ Me neither, I'd rather spend my money on something I'll get something out of __eou__ right. like groceries, or gas for the car or household items.  those things add up. __eou__ they really do, budgeting is super important, and things like the lottery just don't make the cut most of the time __eou__ and if you really sit down and think about your odds of winning, that should be enough discouragement from playing. lol! __eou__ right! In order for one person to win, a whooooole lotta people have to lose __eou__ LOL! right! and i don't want to be the loser.  i like my belly and my gas tank full. __eou__ Same here :) it's just not worth the squeeze __eou__ stay clever! and have a good one.  it was nice chatting with you. __eou__ Thanks, and you as well :) this is fun

Life is so unfair. __eou__ It is! but lately I've been trying to roll with the punches but it's just to hard sometimes. __eou__ It is. Have you tried yoga and meditation? __eou__ no but i always wanted to. is it really worth it? __eou__ I think so. It helps me relax after a hard day at school. __eou__ maybe i will have to try it. just afraid that it will be wasting my time if it i don't see results. __eou__ The stress needs to go. Everything is temporary! What do you do for fun? __eou__ very true, and is work considered "fun"? haha __eou__ I guess, if you like your job! What do you do? I'm keeping my grades up because I want to be a veterinarian. __eou__ I do, and mechanic. that is cool word needs more vets! __eou__ Yeah, I don't think I could be a repair technician, I worry too much about messing things up.
i am a big vegan , my favorite meal are tofu burgers though ! you ? __eou__ i thought about going vegan . i do not eat red meat , so i might give up all meat . __eou__ You totally should. It's well worth the sacrifice.  __eou__ I agree. I don't think I could do that. I may be vegetarian for other adopted reasons. __eou__ What reasons? I just love animals.  __eou__ It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian? __eou__ I started out vegetarian. There are so many options these days, I don't think it limits me. There's an amazing vegan diner next door to my apartment. __eou__ I see! Did you ever attend any vegetarian festival? I went to Vegfest 2016 near the ocean where I live __eou__ I haven't. That sounds fun! I wonder if they have one here in NYC. __eou__ I am unaware of when it is. It's an annual conference though. I learned to surf when I went and I love it now __eou__ Oh man. I'm sure that was fun. I'm not a fan of the beach, personally. __eou__ There's more stuff to do than the beach though! __eou__ Maybe.

Awesome.  Poetry, no doubt. __eou__ yes! you know! __eou__ Used to play it on repeat when I was in college, before I had to drop out. __eou__ yes i love that ! __eou__ Me too!  Where do you work? __eou__ at a plane airport! __eou__ Oh cool, I love airports.  I always think of The Terminal when I'm at one lol
I really wish they would bring back 8 tracks. __eou__ I'm not sure I've ever used them.

What is your favorite song? __eou__ My favorite would have to be All of Me by John Legend. __eou__ wow good, Mine is FRIENDS by Anna marie __eou__ Didn't Marshmello also feature in that song? __eou__ Yes. Indeed  __eou__ I'm sure it was a hit. What do you do for a living?
I wanted to look beautiful to go to church, so I did some things __eou__ Yeah? what did you do? Do tell! __eou__ I put on a sundress and curled my hair __eou__ The weather must have been nice, did you have a good time? __eou__ Yes, it was nice! Do you go to church? __eou__ I go sometimes, but I could probably be more regular about it, haha __eou__ That makes sense! I enjoy the free food __eou__ Oh man, free food!

What about you? __eou__ I never remember my dreams. It's been years. __eou__ Oh, I see. Well that is interesting. What do you do for a living? __eou__ My day job is retail, but I took an evening gig playing piano at a local restaurant. __eou__ Fun! Ihave always wanted to learn how to play the piano but its so complicated and I am just so unmotivated in general. __eou__ It's really fun and relaxing to me. What do you do as a hobby? __eou__ I like to play video games. I often choose playing games more than I should. Sometimes it interferes with me getting my homework done.

That's cool. I have never played high school football, but I have gone to a few games. __eou__ There is so much to enjoy at the games,pep rallies, marching bands and mascots! What was your favourite thing? __eou__ I always liked the fans that dressed up crazy. __eou__ I would always root for my own high school team and go to pep rallies and the homecoming game. __eou__ I met my wife at a high school football game. Now we have been together for 21 years. __eou__ Wow. That's a long time. Congrats! __eou__ Thank you. I attribute the success of our relationship to being good friends and having a good sense of humor. Are you married? __eou__ Haha nope I'm a 26-year-old SINGLE man __eou__ Ah, I remember that lol. I just turned 50 myself. But I feel younger, probably because I keep fit. __eou__ that is good ! i am sure you keep in great shape __eou__ Well, I teach yoga and I do martial arts 4 days a week, so I do okay. How do you keep in shape? __eou__ Yoga-low impact. They have classes for all ages and levels. It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer. __eou__ That's very true. It will also surprise you how much strength you can gain. __eou__ Yoga is great for men also. Its very physical. Yoga first got popular in the western world around the 1980s.
awesome ! i take george to the beach all the time , how about you ? __eou__ when i can . i enjoy surfing . __eou__ I've never tried to surf before. Is it hard to learn? __eou__ Well, depends how much practice you can have, as I live in CAlifornia I have plenty :o __eou__ Ah, that makes sense. Do you have any tips for a beginner? __eou__ Well, you can enrol in some beach-side tuition, they run it in groups - do a search online __eou__ I'll look into that. So how nice is it living in California? __eou__ Its the only place I've ever lived, so no comparison, but I love it here. Where are you ? __eou__ Alabama. Its really pretty but very outdated. __eou__ How so ? __eou__ They seem to be behind the times on everything from decorating to policy. __eou__ OH right lol I wonder why....ahve you considered anywhere else  __eou__ I have, and it may be an option later. I'm from Chicago, so it's nice to not be cold for once.
Yea it tore through teh box office __eou__ It really did! It did as well as the sequel to the other Avengers movies should have. __eou__ I enjoyed it better than the other movies, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time __eou__ Yeah.  The only thing I didn't like was how many people in the theater insisted on talking to the screen! __eou__ That’s annoying! I hate it when people throw popcorn too, so wasteful! __eou__ lol. I'm very particular about movie theater behavior--having your phone out is another irritation of mine. __eou__ Or crunching and rustling sweets. I get very irritable when that happens.  __eou__ It's a lot of irritation to put up with considering how expensive it is to go to the movies now! __eou__ One near us has dropped its prices. They still charge a lot for popcorn and dodgy hotdogs thought.  __eou__ Ha!  We actually still have a working drive in movie theater out here that is nice to visit in the summer __eou__ I have never been to a drive through! I don’t think we have them here.  __eou__ i think a lot of them have closed down, but it is a cool experience if you can find one __eou__ I will certainly look out for one.  What other things do you enjoy doing? __eou__ I'm a writer, so I'm trying to work on one of my projects when I can. __eou__ Writing sounds fun, id like to try that sometime
Dangit!  They burned!! __eou__ Are you baking? What did you burn. __eou__ My brownies! Ugh, the kitchen smells horrible now haha __eou__ Oh no! Do you burn foods often? __eou__ No, hardly ever! I'm a great cook but not the best at baking. Maybe I should just stick to writing. Aspiring journalist here __eou__ Very lucrative career. What do you write about? __eou__ Generally politics. I am fascinated by what motivates politicians to do the outlandish things they do. __eou__ I'm more of a fan of the past than the present. I like the Victorian era. __eou__ My mom is a librarian, I grew up in a home that was more focused on fiction and the past. I'm more interested in here and now __eou__ My mom owned a doll store. I collect them now. My favorite is a doll that looks like Queen Victoria. __eou__ I could understand your love for history in that case. That's more interesting than some of the boring things she would read to us kids haha __eou__ What books would she read to you? __eou__ Usually obscure things that were above my comprehension level for my age __eou__ I have a low comprehension level, I'm sure I wouldn't understand those today
I spent some time with my middle daughter by taking her to ice cream. She is so sweet and lovely. We had a very special time.  __eou__ That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent! __eou__ I try to be! I do get distracted easily though, so I have to work more on always keeping my eye on them. __eou__ i understand. been there. done that. got the tshirt. i am an empty nester. __eou__ lol, congrats on that! I'm really dreading the teenage years. For now, I need to get more serious about school. __eou__ don't worry about the teenage years. just keep reminding them that you love them. wow! and you are going to school, too? __eou__ I am. I'm studying online for my MBA. It's not easy, but I'll get used to it I'm sure. Gotta have faith! __eou__ once you complete it, it will be sssoooo worth it. hang in there. you got this. i am learning how to build websites myself. __eou__ Oh that sounds fun. I had to do that for a Management Information Systems class when I was an undergraduate. I enjoyed it. __eou__ it is fun once i can wrap my head around the concept. javascript is a little bit of a challenge for me. __eou__ I don't remember a whole lot about the class now, other than going to View and then Source was a constant. __eou__ lol! i know what you mean.  the tech stuff can be a nuisance.  __eou__ Like school for me, I'm sure you'll find a way to make it all worth it! __eou__ yep. we got this!  it was wonderful chatting with you. good luck! have a good one. __eou__ Thank you, same to you!
Wow, its a form of exercise, you need to try it you know __eou__ I know running is aerobic and requires stamina as well as mental strength. I just don't enjoy it. __eou__ Not many others do but I can run very fast and for long distances so I quite enjoy it. __eou__ Yeah it is amazing what happens to the body when you run, activity of enzymes and hormones that stimulate the muscles and the heart to work more efficiently. __eou__ I used to run everywhere just to get around my city but my dad recently just gave me his car so I use that now.  __eou__ oh nice, Every do marathons? i heard their is big events in mexico. Been there quite a lot. Even know i hate the food lol.  __eou__ You hate mexican food? haha and no... I have yet to run a marathon. One day I will build up to that.

What takes you there? __eou__ Just the sights and love the culture.  __eou__ It would be pretty awesome to go run a marathon in mexico just for the fun of it.  __eou__ Agreed, such a nice place! __eou__ Where are you from originally? __eou__ originally , from cheyenne where my family is from
one day i plan on being an astronaut __eou__ really wow that sounds way awesome __eou__ I am a huge fan of science. I have a Neil deGrasse Tyson poster! __eou__ i have posters of both neil tyson and degrasse hung up on my wall __eou__ My other poster is of Penn & Teller. They're my favorite magicians. __eou__ Yeah magic is pretty great! __eou__ Do you have a favorite magician?
I took my daughter shopping today __eou__ That sounds like fun! It's great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun? __eou__ Yes, it was a little tiring. I love being able to spoil her, though! __eou__ I can imagine it's good to get to spend the day with your own children! Definitely needs its breaks though.  __eou__ For sure. What do you like to do for fun?  __eou__ I love walks in the forest that's right next to me, I'm not much of a city person. __eou__ Ooh, that's great. I love forests and trees! I paint a lot of trees, actually! __eou__ I especially like how the leaves turn colors. But what do you like to paint with? __eou__ Mostly acrylic, but some watercolor as well. Yes, I LOVE fall! __eou__ Fall is the most photogenic season. But my mother used acrylic too since it was developed in 1934. She's been happy ever since! __eou__ Wow, I didn't know that! Do you paint at all? __eou__ I dabble a bit, but I prefer to use pastels for my art despite the mess they make! __eou__ They're definitely messy. Not my style, but I love seeing others' work! __eou__ So do I, would love to see some of your work sometime. But what else do you like ?
i got pets too . probably why i'm not married . lol __eou__ way she goes . tell me more about yourself __eou__ I love Fall, but my favorite season is Winter. It's great for sleeping in under a warm blanket! __eou__ Me too--i love the snow and i hate hot weather! __eou__ Tell me about it! So, what are you're hobbies? __eou__ I like skiing--I've done that since I was 5 years old, but haven't had much time recently. __eou__ Wow, that sounds awesome! How hard was it to learn? __eou__ My dad taught me when I was 5 so I don't totally remember, but I think the younger you are when you learn something the easier it is __eou__ That's what I've heard. I learned how to be anxious and sleep, haha! __eou__ heh, me too--I'm very good at both of those things now!  So what do you do for fun? __eou__ I like to play video games and try to write fantasy stories. How about you? __eou__ My too!  What are some of your favorite games? __eou__ Harvest Moon (all of them) and anything Mario. What systems do you play on? __eou__ Mainly PC--we have a PS4 but I'm much better on PC (plus the graphics are gorgeous).  Have you played Stardew Valley? __eou__ Oh, yes! I've bought it on every system I have. Have you tried modding on pc games?
She was not polite __eou__ Who was not polite? __eou__ The child at the school where i teach __eou__ That's so sad. What did she do? __eou__ She answered back when i told her off for pushing another child. __eou__ Well, she better learn to be more respectful. People won't tolerate that behavior. Do you think listening to calming music in the classroom would help with the aggression? __eou__ Maybe, calming music soothes my nerves, that and chocolate! Do you have any suggestions? __eou__ Well, my favorite band is Toto, but I don't think rock music would help! Maybe one of those YouTube videos of the ocean? __eou__ Good idea! I will try it next time it happens. Rock music may have them rocking out. __eou__ What do you like to do besides teach? __eou__ I like to read books. What are your hobbies? __eou__ I like walking my dog. His name is Toto.  __eou__ After your favourite band! That’s sweet. I like dogs __eou__ Exactly!

i like apples , they keep you healthy __eou__ so what do you do for a living ? __eou__ I work at a hospital. I am a doctor! __eou__ wow! do you enjoy your work? i am a grocery store manager. __eou__ I love it, but going home is always nice. How is the grocery store life treating you? __eou__ busy ... busy ... busy.  weekends are always mad, but, it is always good to get good discount on healthy food. __eou__ What's your favorite food? __eou__ lasagna ... not so healthy. but it is my favorite.  what about you? __eou__ I like grapes. Their purple color is very appealing to me. __eou__ those are my favorite produce. i have some sitting in the fridge right now! i like to eat them with almonds. __eou__ I wear a lot of purple so I don't stain my clothes when I spill the grapes. __eou__ wow! purple grapes and purple scrubs.  i bet you get lots of smiles :) __eou__ I sure do! Lots of patients love the creativity. __eou__ so precious! it was great chatting with you.  keep grapes alive! have a good one.
My friend randomly brought me a cake to thank me for watching her dogs while she was away __eou__ yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it. __eou__ have you ever been to japan __eou__ Nope. Never been. You? __eou__ I went over the summer. Nice place to visit. The citizens are welcoming __eou__ Nice. There are some good violin players in japan that  I would like to learn from __eou__ You are into music? How long have you played? __eou__ Yes. I've been playing for about 3 years now. Not great at it though. Do you play?
I do not like being bothered when I am working. __eou__ Me too, it throws my frequency off.  __eou__ especially when I've entered a very productive streak __eou__ Absolutely. I hate getting thrown off. I am a very driven person. __eou__ Me too, I like the feeling of accomplishing something, from start to finish. That is its own reward. __eou__ I agree. I coach football and that's a message I tell my players. __eou__ That's awesome, I haven't played sports in a while but I've been thinking about volunteering for my local youth club, they currently need more referees __eou__ You should try it! Get some experience and you'd be more qualified than the NFL referees. __eou__ I'm really considering it, especially since I could take my kid there to get some quality playing time __eou__ You should do that! I'm sure your kid would love it. My brother used to referee at the youth club. __eou__ Cool, how flexible are the schedules? It's hard to balance things with my job and toddler __eou__ I would have to ask my brother. He still lives in my hometown, Syracuse. __eou__ Right, plus I bet it depends on the different clubs... I'll keep looking into it. __eou__ I wish you the best of luck!
I am so upset with my children __eou__ That's no good. Why are you upset with them? __eou__ They were badly behaved in the car today. __eou__ Oh no! How old are they? __eou__ Eight, Five and a one year old __eou__ I am ten, so a little bit older than them. __eou__ Yes two years older than my eldest. Do you enjoy school? __eou__ I do not. But tomorrow is my first day of safety patrol so I am excited! __eou__ What is safety patrol? __eou__ We help the younger kids cross the street safely. __eou__ Oh that sounds like a great thing to do! Do you like helping people? __eou__ I do! It is the best. __eou__ What is your favourite school lesson? __eou__ I like math! Adding and subtracting is so fun.
Yeah, I am always interested in the different kinds of stamps used around the world. __eou__ Me too, I would love to have some old stamps that were issued in the 1840 when some one the worlds first stamps were issued. __eou__ That would be cool! My best friend from tanzania some times sends me the stamps they have over there. __eou__ That is so amazing! My best friend is visiting me from Tanzania next week! __eou__ That's so cool! what are you guys gonna do? __eou__ He is just as passionate about collecting stamps as I am so we are going to go to a few auctions and seee if there are any good deals __eou__ Always good to have a hobby you can do together! My friend and I are always cracking jokes to each other! __eou__ Yes it is. For whatever reason when we get together, almost like a ritual, we watch our favorite movie - Dirty Harry. Have you ever seen it? __eou__ Love that movie! but comedy is more of my genre! laughter is the best medicine!  __eou__ I completely agree! You have to laugh in life for health and happiness. Comedy movies are a great source of joy in my life, second to stamp collecting ;) __eou__ If i can have a good laugh, i will always be happy! and haha! it's a great hobby! __eou__ It's the perfect hobby because there is always a never ending stream of new stamps. What is your favorite hobby? __eou__ Very true! And going to the movies!  __eou__ What is your favorite movie?
I'm torn up, my dog had to be put down today because of old age __eou__ Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough. __eou__ my puppy was 18 years old.  i don't think there is another that can take her place. she was beautiful. __eou__ Oh goodness, that has to be hard. 18 is a long life for a dog, but it never feels like it's long enough __eou__ i know. my son was hinting at finding me a new pup ... but i am not feelin' that.  the attachment and all. __eou__ That makes sense, it's a big commitment. It's ok if it's not the right time. __eou__ thank you for listening. what about you? you got any pets?
Well sure we are here to procreate and that takes two and raising a family is a teamwork kind of thing __eou__ Right, yeah. But what also blew my mind when reading up about the cultural aspect of marriage is the fact that child marriage, polygamy, and forced marriages still exist in today's day and age. They're all cultural traditions that are celebrated and enforced. __eou__ I'm actually not legally married to my husband (though I call him that). We are common-law partners.  Doesn't bother me but I'm sure it would bug some people. __eou__ I haven't managed to find anyone yet, but I think as long as your in love, your legal status doesn't matter __eou__ Agreed.  For us, marriage just seemed like a waste of money--you can do a lot more exciting things with that amount! __eou__ Yes, you can! What do you guys like to do together? __eou__ We play video games, watch movies. He's a lot more athletic than I am, but I try to join him on hikes when I can. __eou__ That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! I'm rather lazy myself, I just like to sleep in.  __eou__ Oh, me too!  I'm a night owl and I hate getting up early in the morning. __eou__ Mornings are the worse! I've been trying to find a night job so I can sleep all day. __eou__ I did that through a lot of university!  What do you like to do for fun? __eou__ Mostly watching tv. I haven't found any good shows lately.  __eou__ What are some of your favorites?  My top two are definitely The Wire and Deadwood. __eou__ I really enjoyed Stranger Things and Sabrina. I tried watching This Is Us recently but couldn't get into it.
I can't wait until this weekend __eou__ why is that? __eou__ I get to spend the weekend with my daughter, she loves shopping so I'm gonna spoil her silly! __eou__ That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend. I spent last weekend shopping. __eou__ Yeah? What kind of stuff did you buy? __eou__ I didn't buy much but did find some new clothes to wear to work. Are you looking to buy anything in particular this weekend? __eou__ That's good, as my wife says, you can never have enough clothes! But nothing too expensive hopefully, have to save for Christmas. __eou__ I can't believe Christmas is almost here. I don't start to think about it until after Thanksgiving. __eou__ I think about it all year round I really like Christmas time, especially when it snows. __eou__ It doesn't snow around where I live so it's hard to get in the Christmas mood with warmer weather __eou__ Well on the up side at least you don't have to shovel any of it when you can barely feel you're hands because of the cold! __eou__ Yes, it definitely has it's benefits! __eou__ Indeed. But do you have any special plans for Christmas time? __eou__ Nothing planned yet. It's hard for me to travel because I can't walk
Yeah their food is so fancy! Do you know anything about french food? __eou__ Yes I do. Firstly, cheese and wine are a must! Usually at every meal! __eou__ I love a good glass of wine every once in a while, so long as I am not with my kids or at my shop __eou__ Wine is good, and a must for a French meal. I like red best for drinking and cooking __eou__ I am also a fan of red. __eou__ I think red wine goes best with cheese. I like smelly cheese, the smellier the better! __eou__ What is your favorite kind of cheese? __eou__ I think my favourite kind of cheese is Brie. What about you? __eou__ I like Kraft singles. __eou__ Kraft singles have a special place in my heart. A burger is nothing without them. __eou__ I make my children bread and Kraft single sandwiches every day before school! __eou__ Kraft sandwiches are a staple of the American diet __eou__ Kraft singles and Slim Jim's. __eou__ I was 14 when i had my first Slim Jim
Well, then maybe I like Heavy metal, because I like Van Halen.  What is acid rock? __eou__ It grew out of 196's drug culture.  Think of Jimi Hendrix and his distorted guitar solos and long improvised jams. __eou__ That's so interesting. I like listening to all genres of music, except country music. __eou__ Same! More of a metal guy. Always blasting it in my black car! __eou__ Very cool :) I like to listen to music and podcasts while I drive, it helps pass the time __eou__ Me too.  It really helps get me going on the drive in. __eou__ Yep, gotta do something to pass the time. Audiobooks are fun too __eou__ Yes, audiobooks are great. Have you heard about Carrier language? __eou__ I've never heard of that, what is it? __eou__ It's a Northern Athabaskan dialect, named after the Daketh people. __eou__ Oh, that's fascinating! I'll admit I had to google a few of those terms :) __eou__ do it! i always keep transliteration of it in my purse. which is also black! i love the color black! 
Never heard of them, I am in New York City. __eou__ Do you ever feel closed in with all those people? It is the most densely populated city in the United States. __eou__ I do live in a big city, tons of people. However, I never feel closed in- I feel like the opportunists are boundless. Especially after graduating college.  __eou__ oh, wow! congratulations! what was your major? __eou__ My major was American literature and education. Aiming to make it big in the the big city. Where are you from? __eou__ nashville, tennessee! the great music city!  the population has boomed. it's like a little new york city. __eou__ That is a great city! I used to live up north in Kentucky. Always loved to visit the beautiful city of Nashville! __eou__ kentucky is beautiful country. lots of land.  do you miss kentucky? __eou__ Everyday, thats where my family lives. Is Nashville where you were born? __eou__ no. i was born in birmingham. i don't miss it, though. __eou__ Oh ok, also visited birmingham... Would much rather be in Nashville as well ;) __eou__ right! nashville is awesome. lots of opportunity. __eou__ Very cool. Lost of opportunity everywhere though if we seek it. What takes you to Nashville? __eou__ education and opportunity. it never failed me.  it was good chatting with you. much luck to you! have a good one!
I'm afraid I've never heard of him. Can you tell me a little about him? __eou__ You must have heard his song "Shape of you", it's very popular now.. He was born in England and he attended the academy of contemporary music  __eou__ Oh yeah I'v heard of that one. My son plays it on repeat 24/7! __eou__ He was in an episode of Game of Thrones as well __eou__ I love that show. Have not had time to finish it yet but I hear the ending is not the best. __eou__ It was not how i wanted it to end. Maybe you will enjoy it? __eou__ I hope so, but with the petition that was created to get the last season re-done my hopes are not very high. __eou__ I guess i prefer sports __eou__ Yeah? what kind of sports are you into? __eou__ I'm into Soccer, basketball and Football those are my favorite major professional sports. __eou__ I'm not the biggest fan of soccer but I do like Football, I used to play when i was younger. __eou__ You are never to old to kick the pall around. Over 24.4 million people play in the USA __eou__ Well I did not know that, but I injured my knee a while back so if it weren't for that I would have definitely taken it up again! __eou__ That is a shame, what do you enjoy doing instead?
that is cool . good luck . i photograph dancers sometimes . __eou__ nice . maybe you can be our teams photographer one day . got to talk to teach though . __eou__ what do you like to do outside of work? I like to go out with my friends __eou__ Well, I am actually a highschool student so I dont work quite yet. I love to just kick back with my boyfriend and watch disney movies!  __eou__ That sounds relaxing :) movies are a nice way to spend the evening, what's your favorite disney film? __eou__ I personally love the Toy Story films. What about you? __eou__ Oh those are great! I haven't seen the fourth one yet __eou__ Yeah... it is ok but nothing like the others!!  __eou__ Wow, that different?

Then we are off to the Don Cesar in St.Petersburg. Have you ever heard of it? __eou__ no! i haven't sounds luxurious.  is it a five-star hotel? __eou__ Yes it is. It's really old and looks like a giant pink stucco castle, but it's fabulous inside. Great way to finish the trip. __eou__ sounds amazing! what type of architecture do you think they based it on? __eou__ I'm not sure, but it looks like it's old Spanish style architecture. Do you know a lot about architecture? __eou__ no. not really. just the basics. love to look at it.  have fun at clearwater beach! it was good chatting with you. __eou__ of course ! thank you as well !

Same __eou__ I listened to a podcast about the show and they seem to think the next episode will be a great one __eou__ I would love to listen to more podcasts especially while im out on my daily runs.  __eou__ That's the main time I listen as well __eou__ Awesome!

ohh, that's what it is. that sounds like fun. how can you grill on the back of your car?! __eou__ Its where you bring a portable grill and lay it on your tailgate, usually on a truck, But most people I know do it even if their vehicles dont have tailgates. __eou__ now people who throw tailgate parties are fanatics about football. who is your favorite football team? __eou__ I like the Eagles. What about you? __eou__ sad to say, i am not into sports. but if i was into sports, my college team would be bama and my pro team would be the cowboys __eou__ so you've never been tailgating then? __eou__ no ... i am one of those homebodies who gets a thrill out of netflix, a cup of hot peppermint tea and a good book. __eou__ Binge watching is a hell of a lot better than binge drinking, that's alcoholism in a nutshell. My favorite Netflix show is Ozarks __eou__ lol ... mine is  .... (in my whisper voice) lucifer.  i was raised in a strict christian household. lol! __eou__ never seen it before but i've heard good things __eou__ it is insanely crazy. if it is not against your moral aptitude, you should watch it. lol. it was great chatting with you. have a good one! __eou__ will do! nice chatting __eou__ and drink two beers for me at your next tailgate party! lol. __eou__ lol i will bring enough for both of us
I like to use it as a family vehicle myself, some people use them to do offroading activities I think though. __eou__ They are designed for use on rougher surfaces, but most people use them on city streets and highways. __eou__ Yep.. they actually used to be called ORVs.. (I learned that from Goonies) __eou__ Well I didn't know that but i like that film! I'v seen it a million times. __eou__ Me too.  We actually were in a heavily modified SUV Land Rover last year in Africa on Safari __eou__ Oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. Would be nice to see powerful animals outside of a zoo! __eou__ It was an amazing experience.. we were on a hunting / conservation trip so I actually got to shoot a lion (for a good cause) __eou__ That makes for a good story! Don't know if i could do that though, can barely kill a spider __eou__ Yeah, it was definitely an interesting experience.  When I got back home, I built a small clay diorama of the experience (I do clay modeling) __eou__ That sounds like a fun project! I took a pottery class once but one of my dogs knocked my masterpiece over soon after I brought it home.  __eou__ Aww, that stinks.  Dogs are awesome pets but they can definitely be a bit clumsy.  But yes, clay sculpting is a lot of fun and very therapeutic. __eou__ They definitely can be! I have three so can be a bit hectic at times. Should definitely show me some of your work sometime. __eou__ I would love to do that.  I'm working on a Marvel comics themed piece now that I should be done with soon. __eou__ That sounds great! I love seeing other peoples art.
I've been there! It's beautiful! What are you hoping to see in the area? __eou__ While it's been ranked as one of the best beach is the US we plan on going to see Winter the Dolphin and then we will see if we have time for the actual beach __eou__ That sounds like it would be beautiful! __eou__ I can't wait, everyone says it is the most magical place on Earth! __eou__ I believe it. Anything near a beach tends to hold magical properties. Paradise __eou__ I'm super excited. I'd love to live in a beach house. Have you ever been to Clearwater Beach before? __eou__ I have actually. Out in Florida?  __eou__ Yep. Clearwater is in Pinellas County near Tampa here on the Gulf coast of Florida. Nowadays I live in Palm Harbor. __eou__ Beautiful area. My brother and I want to move there. He thinks he is a viking. What a weirdo __eou__ Being by the ocean, seeing boats could give him a small fantasy to keep the memories alive and well. Viking means pirate in the Old english. Fun Fact :) __eou__ Thats interesting. My masters degree I am currently getting is in italin literature. Do you know anything about that? __eou__ Very cool. I thought about majoring in Italian, too, but didn't. I hope your degree helps you land a job you'd like! I don't know much about it __eou__ Oh that is cool. Thought I might ask! What have you decided to major in? __eou__ I originally wanted to get a BA in economics.
drawing of ponies ? no real pets ? __eou__ nope my mom is allergic to anything with hair __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that, I can't imagine not having pets __eou__ yeah i would love to get a little yorkie __eou__ Yorkies are great, I'm more of a cat person myself though __eou__ I prefer dogs but I still like cats. how many do you have? __eou__ I only have one, it's a good companion but independent enough to take care of itself while I'm at work __eou__ cats are probably better for people who work away from home. i was watching someone's dog once and they refused to eat until their owner returned __eou__ That sounds stressful. I work long hours at a doctor's office so I can't have pets that require too much attention, unfortunately __eou__ Oh, I am sorry to hear that, it seems like it would be an exhausting job, so that is understandable __eou__ It is, but it's very rewarding! I do spend a lot of time outside of work reviewing patient files, but it's not too bad. __eou__ Lucky it's a rewarding job. There are so many jobs out there that the world would be better off without __eou__ That is definitely true. What do you do? __eou__ Random gigs here and there. But mostly trying to get a communal garden going 
what kind of sea food do you like __eou__ crab legs and shrimp . just got endless shrimp at red lobster last night ! __eou__ I used to be a server at red lobster. Endless shrimp was the reason why I quit :) haha __eou__ man i LOVE shrimp! I have ever since I was young enough to remember __eou__ Thats awesome. Shrimp really is delicious. Right now it's only $15.99 for all the shrimp you can eat. THAT IS RIDICULOUS __eou__ true ! i was raised near the ocean so i really love seafood. I tend to eat more than I should sometimes. It can get expensive  __eou__ I love it too but not as much as I love playing guitar. Do you ever play guitar? __eou__ sadly not since high school but i do guitar when i have time to myself __eou__ That is fun! Do you have any animals?  __eou__ Yes, I have a small Boston Terrier, Ollie. He's 12 years old, but still thinks he is invincible when trying to run after cats on his leash. __eou__ Haha thats funny. I have a dog and two cats. My cats always gang up on my boxer. It is hilarious.  __eou__ I love boxers, and their cut off tails. Ollie's is the same way! I have outside cats, but they tend to stay away until Ollie's inside.  __eou__ That is too funny. I love my animals more than anything.  __eou__ I love them all! Cats, dogs, bunnies, BUGS lol- wildlife :) Oh- I could never leave an abused animal to be hurt outside. They are so innocent
Pizza was created in Naples and has become popular world wide since then __eou__ Pizza can be topped with vegetables or meats. __eou__ pizza can also have vegan cheese __eou__ Vegan cheese? Sounds delicious. I might buy a Vegan Cheese Pizza tonight after selling some clothes on facebook __eou__ I could go for a pizza for dinner also  __eou__ Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer. Blue Moon is my favorite. It best served with an orange __eou__ besides from pizza being my favorite, beer is amazing. I'm currently drinking an IPA __eou__ Yumm. I love to drink beer but my husband is a pastor so I have to keep it to a minimum haha __eou__ Haha I have no pets so I can spend my money on all the beer __eou__ Sounds like you are also a homeless man? __eou__ Nah I have a wife, Just not a fan of animals __eou__ Oh, tell me more about your wife! __eou__ Well we're pretty much the same. We both love pizza and beer, what more could you want! __eou__ Haha intimacy would be nice ;) just kidding. 
I'm eagerly waiting on a bigger self-employed paycheck by the end of this month.  Whoopeee __eou__ Congratulations! what do you do? __eou__ I currently tutor special needs individuals __eou__ That sounds like a very rewarding career? __eou__ My end goal is to be a special education teacher __eou__ Really, are you presently in college? __eou__ Yeah, although I have switched schools a lot __eou__ What makes you switch schools? Isn't that kind of expensive? __eou__ Yeah but my tutoring gigs make up for the cost. I guess I am just hard to please when it comes to education __eou__ I have never been to college. I'm a retired tech supervisor. __eou__ How did you like that job __eou__ It was great. I worked on building controls, fire systems and security systems. __eou__ That sounds like an interesting career. Were you always interested in that sort of stuff? __eou__ Yeah, I use to tinker a lot and then I went to electronics school after I got out of the Navy.
I love camping! I'm going down to the beach this weekend and going to sleep out there for a couple of days! __eou__ That is awesome and sounds like so much fun! What are you most excited for? __eou__ birding.  I love to bird watch at the beach since there are so many different birds __eou__ The weathers supposed to be good this weekend, perfect to go camping! What's your favourite type of bird? __eou__ It is supposed to be very pretty.  I don't live near a shoreline, so I love to see all the sandpipers and pelicans. __eou__ I can imagine! Do you have a bird bath? They're great for attracting many different species to visit your garden, especially when it's hot and there's little water around elsewhere. __eou__ I do, and several feeders.  Have you ever gone on a birding hike or anything like that?
what do you do ? have any pets ? i have a lizard __eou__ the business is a restaurant . . . italian food . i have a cat . __eou__ Oh wow I've always dreamed of a restaurant, I love to cook especially for my family. __eou__ I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together. __eou__ I personally love cooking desserts the most. Good thing I have a dog so I can take him on long walks to walk all the calories off! __eou__ You are so right about that.  I like to eat and limiting calories I eat is quite difficult. __eou__ I agree, the best foods is the most calorie dense! __eou__ So true. I always eat it all.  __eou__ It's hard because my wife likes to split all the time __eou__ yes i believe it lol ! so what kind of food do you like ? i am craving italian ! __eou__ I could really go for some pasta! I'm always craving pizza though lol __eou__ We just had pizza last night with the family. My kids love it! __eou__ did you make it or order it? __eou__ We ordered from a local Italian restaurant. My favorite is white pizza, what about you?
My husband threw away a very important document yesterday and I was so mad at himk. __eou__ Oh no! what was it and what will you do? __eou__ I make my Husband look for it because I really need that document  __eou__ oh no ! i'm so sorry . what was it ? __eou__ an important document __eou__ Can it be replicated by whomever sent it? Sometimes I misplace my bank statements, and I have to call the bank for an additional copy __eou__ My bank statements are paperless, its a important document not statements __eou__ I see. How has he done so far in finding it? __eou__ hes not doing good at all, I'm never find it at this point __eou__ oh i see . maybe he just needs some time . will you start helping him soon if he has no luck? __eou__ Maybe, I feel like I have to, two heads are better then one __eou__ yea thats probably a smart move __eou__ I know right, how are you? __eou__ Pretty crappy at the moment. My arm pain is acting up where I broke it skiing 6 years ago __eou__ Do you take any meds for it? __eou__ Yes, I take over the counter advil  __eou__ You some stronger meds
I would love to live in Alaska although I am not that familiar with living conditions in the state. __eou__ I know they have pretty brutal winters, that's for sure. __eou__ I don’t think I could take brutal, __eou__ I've been to Maine, and it's pretty cold there too __eou__ The coldest I’ve ever felt is Connecticut. Cold is nice, freezing, not so much. __eou__ Honestly, I hate the cold.  In fact, the only state I haven't visited is Alaska
Does it feel like muscular pain __eou__ No it is in the lumbar area which is the most common areas for Pain __eou__ I have chronic back pain too. It can be frustrating. How long has it been going on? __eou__ It has probably been about 8 months are so __eou__ Wow, that's a long time. Have you seen a doctor to find out what might be causing it? Mine is a pinched nerve from a slipped disk.  __eou__ I have seen a doctor today. He give me lab tests to do but I am afraid of the results. __eou__ The waiting is the worst part if you ask me. The uncertainty. Did the doctor do any imaging tests? __eou__ Well the MRI was clear but my mother has MS and it can be diagnosed with an MRI - so it was a bit nerve wracking to say the least. __eou__ Yes, I have MS but not spinal, I actually suffer from the brain lesions. Luckily it hasn't flared up since 2017 __eou__ that is quite interesting , have you ever thought of having it removed ? __eou__ I've only had one flare up so it's early at this point, but I will if it does flare up  __eou__ i heard the procedure is painless .  __eou__ It has immediate pain following surgery but usually after about a week, yes __eou__ I really hope that it all works out for you. 
am fine and how about you __eou__ not to bad . just got done playing with my parrot . __eou__ Whoa!  You have a parrot!  That's kinda cool.  I wish I could have a pet. __eou__ I had always wanted one, and I finally made the choice to get one. __eou__ I always wanted a dog, but my wife won't allow it. __eou__ If i had a dog, he would probably eat my parrot! __eou__ HaHa!  That's true.  Does your parrot talk?  If so, what does he say? __eou__ Yes he's very vocal and interacts with me a lot. He __eou__ What's his name? __eou__ His name is Burt Reynolds. What would you name your dog if you got one? __eou__ OMG, that's a great name!  I've always wanted a dog named Jeff.  I like it when pets have people names. __eou__ Me too. My youngest brother is named Jeff, we don't get along. You should try to get a dog though! __eou__ No way about your brother.  I wish I could, but my wife is not really into pets. __eou__ I don't get along with any of my siblings. Maybe your wife will change her mind one day?
I don't know a lot about Italian food, other than I like it.  Are there a lot of regional variations? __eou__ Yes! There are actually huge variations! Especially between the north and south parts of the Italian peninsula. __eou__ What are the specific differences between Northern and Southern Italian food? __eou__ Well, there are differences due to Italy's regional diversity, especially between the North and South of the peninsula. __eou__ I am intrigued to know what kinds of differences there are. __eou__ Well, the Italian cuisine varies greatly by region, especially from the north and the south of the country's peninsula. __eou__ Why are the regions of Italy so different? __eou__ Well I don't know all of Italy's regions, but there seems to be some major differences in the food between the north (alps) and the south of the Italian peninsula. __eou__ It is so interesting. I wonder what the cause of the diversity is. __eou__ It's probably due to immigration patterns. But it's even more popular in England because of the imperial past. Of course, British cuisine also includes influences from China and North America. __eou__ That makes sense actually! __eou__ it is actually my favorite . . . i love everything italian . especially the wine , food and films . __eou__ Lasagna is an Italian dish right? That's actually my favorite food! __eou__ Yes! Lasagna! I love tomatoes and cheese haha!
I see.     They are not funded particularly well. __eou__ No - I understand there's currently some debate about the future of the civilian space program __eou__ Yes, I am desperate for both me and him that it get approved.  __eou__ It's such a shame - the organisation that won the space race might be in jeopardy __eou__ I know right! Now a days, satellites are more important that asteroids, which always blew me away in science class. Luckily I married the brains __eou__ totally agree . maybe i could really afford to go to space haha __eou__ I'm sure it will be expensive since Nasa isn't properly funded. But it would be a once in a lifetime vacation. 
swimming is fun . do you go to the beach as well ? __eou__ sometimes i do . while i'm asleep __eou__ While you're asleep?  How do you go swimming asleep? __eou__ I normally have a recurring dream of swimming out too far from the shore and drown. __eou__ Oh!  That makes more sense.  It's odd, I've never had a swimming dream.  Maybe you're stressed __eou__ yeah I really think that might be the case. Although when I wake up from the dream, I'm often happy that it's just a dream you know?  __eou__ I think I read somewhere that nightmares - the stress kind - are on the rise due to the political divisions in the world.  Are you a political person?
I can't wait to have grandkids. IS that weird? __eou__ Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild, and then when they poop or get fussy, to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents! __eou__ Haha yes its just something about having the kids come up to new york for the weekend and being about to see them! but not for too long lol __eou__ I have a cruise planned next month, but I would love cooking for grandkids.  __eou__ where is the cruise to? __eou__ Bahama's. I've always wanted to see islands. The beauty of them amazes me,  __eou__ I would love to see the bahamas! sadly I've never been out of the county __eou__ Me either! I figured the next time I head to a tropic resort location on some island I'll give it a go and I did!  __eou__ I have been to hawaii which feels out of the US but it's not! __eou__ Wow! Hawaii sounds like a great place to vacay.  I have never been there, but I wanna go! How was it? __eou__ it was amazing! i reccommend it to anyone __eou__ i never been but i am very excited to go ! what do you do for fun ? __eou__ i like to rock climb, you? __eou__ I'm scared of heights, but I love cooking
She works at a high school. __eou__ Does she just clean? Sometimes janitors do maintenance and securitites too. __eou__ I think so, I’m not sure. __eou__ I was very close to my janitor in elementary school.  He was always very nice to me. __eou__ I wasn’t, they never really talked much if I’m being honest __eou__ I didn't really get along with my classmates much, so he was a friendly man and kept the bad kids away from me. __eou__ That’s pretty nice of him. __eou__ It was. He's always had my back. __eou__ You really need a friend in school. Could only image what kids these days go through __eou__ I think there is such polarization in the climate.  Some kids, especially special needs kids, are really just targets. __eou__ Yea, to make others feel powerful. Which is really unfair __eou__ Indeed, that's true.  I just worry what long-term effects it will have on some of them.  It's hard to concentrate on school when your mind is hurting. __eou__ We’re really seeing the effects these days. When you look back not the people committing crimes, they had really tough school lives. __eou__ Everyday we hear about it more and more.  Schools should really address this more thoughtfully, from Kindergarten on up
Just walked my dog 2 miles and now we are just chilled out, relaxing on the couch. It's been a good day! __eou__ That's a good effective walk! __eou__ I know, I'm on a diet, so I can lose weight and get hearty with my dog __eou__ That will really help you to maintain your overall health. __eou__ Yes I know, Whats your favorite color? Mines is blue __eou__ Mine is green, but I like blue too and blue is apparently between violet and green.
Pit bull __eou__ yes, these are the dogs which were used in blood sports, that are now banned __eou__ That's a shame. What else do you enjoy doing? Do you swim? __eou__ Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement I have a swimming pool __eou__ I agree, I begun swimming when I was young. I like to think I'm fit! __eou__ With my job it can be difficult sometimes to find time for swimming and my two pit bulls __eou__ That's fair. What are the pit bull's names? __eou__ Lucy, and Jade - Jade has beautiful blue eyes and lucys are brown __eou__ Blue is my second favorite color besides purple. How old are they? __eou__ They are 13 and 10.  Thank you! __eou__ Do they ever go in your swimming pool? __eou__ Not really. They are more lazy than anything, but when they were younger, they did all the time __eou__ That's cute. Wish I could be lazy all the time like a pampered pooch! __eou__ I know right! If we did, then they would want to go out alll the time
Yes they seem to be nice dogs __eou__ They are also an always changing cross breed of the fastest of dogs in the area __eou__ What are your pets names? __eou__ my dog's name is bruce __eou__ That's adorable. How old is bruce? __eou__ bruce is only a year. do you have dogs? __eou__ I have 2, a boston terrier, and a pit bull. Ollie is the terrier and Jade is the pitt __eou__ Thats terrific. Your Boston probably is black, brindle, or seal colored. Is that right? __eou__ Yes, black coat, with white paws and belly. He loves taking rides in my Charger. His and my favorite hobby are loving our cars __eou__ My dog's also black haired. Matches me haha. I bet he loves car rides. what year is the car? __eou__ 2019, I like to stay current with the Chargers, I've had one since 2014 each year they are released. I lease mine so I can ensure the new one __eou__ Ah very smart. Definitely a pretty car __eou__ Yes, high upkeep but worth it.  __eou__ deff worth it!
I was always so afraid to go to sleep when I was a little kid...Always thought there were spooky monsters under the bed. __eou__ I think some kids go through that. Did your parents comfort you? __eou__ They didn't, unfortunately. We don't get along these days. __eou__ Hey how are you __eou__ I think I'm okay. I haven't come out to my parents yet, I don't think they would accept it. __eou__ i'm sorry to hear . what happened to your parents ? __eou__ They are homophobic but I can't tell them. I prefer to be alone and draw. __eou__ Have you talked  to them about being homophobic __eou__ No, I'm not sure how. Maybe it's the generation gap? __eou__ maybe that's the reason __eou__ I think so. Do you think one day they could accept it?
no i use to have a dog but my mom gave her away __eou__ oh no , how sad . i am sorry . __eou__ It's ok, I didn't have much time for her anyway. __eou__ I felt the same way about my mom's dog when he passed. It felt like a member of my family was taken away from me too soon. __eou__ Yeah, it's hard.  If only they could just stay with us forever. __eou__ Pets are family members for sure. It's okay to be sad as if your mom has passed __eou__ What was your dogs name?  Mine was Millie.  __eou__ My dog's name was Cookie. __eou__ Oh that's sweet!  I love that name.  __eou__ It's a very cute name, unlike my lizards xD __eou__ you have lizards?!?! They creep me out.  __eou__ They are actually pretty chill lol Nagini and I have been friends for years __eou__ How big is he? __eou__ He is about 12 inches! My mom was scared that if he grew any bigger he would look like the monsters from Stranger Things XD 
i'm doing very well . __eou__ where are you ? home or out ? __eou__ im at home, whether i go home or out i have an amazing view of the mountains since that where i live __eou__ that's great , i wish i had a view of the mountains . __eou__ It's worth it since i don't have a tv to watch __eou__ Do you hike up those mountains?  __eou__ yes i love to hike. you? __eou__ Most people hike in groups or with friends, but I myself love to hike alone. I just love taking in the experience in my own little world __eou__ i agree its amazing alone. but i do enjoy it with my wife __eou__ I'd hike with a wife too if I had one. When I try to find a soulmate it always ends up being someone I should never have trusted. __eou__ how about a pet? __eou__ I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one? __eou__  i have 2 cats __eou__ are they house cats?
Yeah he jumps around and smashes the bad guys __eou__ What do you think about Tracer? I think her peppy and energetic attitude is really charming. __eou__ I love Tracer! She's probably my favorite character out of any game ive played and i have played alot of games haha! __eou__ I have a lot of games too. Which kind is your favorite? I like RPG’s __eou__ You have alot of games!? How many!? I have a fair amount but not what id call alot! I love MMO's! Sorry if im taking what you said too literally __eou__ I love MMO’s too, maybe a total of 40 games if not under __eou__ Ah, okay haha, I was thinking hundreds. Sorry, I take things too literally sometimes. __eou__ Lol maybe if I count digitally as well. And other systems. In general I normally only count my switch and ps4. The only things I play __eou__ Ah, I see! that makes sense. Which do you like more, the switch or the ps4? __eou__ That’s a tough one. I like my switch for overnight travel. But the ps4 beats when it comes to serious gaming. How about you? __eou__ That makes sense, I personally love the switch because of all of the nintendo exclusives. __eou__ True,  but the core gaming is important to me. I’m a CoD fan __eou__ Oh thats awesome, yeah I wish we could have the best of both worlds. Wish the switch got CoD haha __eou__ Seriously. Even if its like black ops 3, that would still be so cool.
oh my, rose science really does it for me. when were roses invented? __eou__ They weren't "invented" but they are native to Asia, with some in Europe, North America and northwestern Africa. __eou__ Hah, right. Sorry I don't pay attention. I'd never even heard of Bob Marley. __eou__ I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little! But you have to at least know "No Woman No Lie!" __eou__ Nope, never listened to anything but metal. Heavy music lets me cut loose. __eou__ I've only listened to alternative myself, do you recommend any artist? __eou__ Start with the classics. Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica, Iron Maiden.  __eou__ Right on, I will give them a listen. How do you feel about female singers? __eou__ They are amazing. Paramore has a great vocalist. We partied hard at their recent show. __eou__ That's super rad! If you like her you would enjoy Cleo Sol. She isn't well known yet but she is a star in her own right! __eou__ I'll look up Cleo Sol. I'm always open to new music, I even started listening to Bob Marley eventually! __eou__  We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I should make it my goal to promote underground artist xD __eou__ Check out bandcamp.com, so many underground artists if you search via a genre you like. Some crazy tunes on there. __eou__ I am well aware of bandcamp acually! I gotta listen to the artists that are only posting on there while I am baking
i listen to a ton of music , honestly . it is my main pasttime __eou__ that is cool . i like art __eou__ You do? Who is your favorite artist? __eou__ I dont really play favorites. I like variety, since im actually a middle school art teacher __eou__ Awesome! I always loved Degas when I was younger since I took ballet. __eou__ I dont know much about ballet to be honest. __eou__ I danced for over 10 years, but it's not my favorite genre of dance. A great base, but too strict. __eou__ I suppose that makes sense. Also, the differences in dances around the world is something that intrigues me. So many cultures __eou__ The different cultural dances are so beautiful. I'm in love with Caribbean and Chinese styles of dance and stroytelling. __eou__ I also find Indian dance and Japanese dance fascinating. I love the different costumes and moves they use. __eou__ Yes, the costumes are so colorful! __eou__ I wonder what dance was like in ancient Egypt. Dance has existed for millennia, surely it existed then.  __eou__ That would be interesting to see. I don't think I've ever learned anything about ancient Egyptian dance or even musical instruments. __eou__ Early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials. I would like to visit the pyramids just to learn more of the culture
Yes I love pudding too, do you know which country they originate from? __eou__  The word "pudding" is believed to come from the French "boudin" so it seems to have come from France! __eou__ It's wonderful but it is rough on my stomach.  You have any favorite desserts? __eou__ Any custard. What about you? __eou__ Ice Cream!! I love living in Texas bc there are more warm days than not so a cold dessert is always a fave. __eou__ Me too.  There are some strange combinations though, have you heard of bacon ice cream? where they add bacon and even egg custard to the freezing mixture! __eou__ Ewww that's a little overboard... I'm more of a birthday cake ice cream kinda girl! lol
well , i am currently in college , home is in california . __eou__ i am in college too ! i am a total jock in on an athletic scholarship . __eou__ What sport do you play? __eou__ I play football. My parents got me into it at a young age, but frankly I wish I could be more serious about other subjects in school __eou__ Well, at least your love for football got you a scholarship! That's more than a lot of people can say. __eou__ Very true. Too many people are not fortunate enough to acquire funding for their education/career paths __eou__ Exactly. College is super expensive, so any funding you can get is a blessing. __eou__ Yes, university has gotten so expenssive. A medical school education now costs over a hundred thousand dollars. __eou__ That's more than a lot of entry level medical professionals can hope to make it a year!  __eou__ Indeed. If the post-secondary education system could be cheaper, a lot more people would have access to their life goals __eou__ Very true. And a lot of people are entering college without really knowing what they want to do, thus wasting money. __eou__ Thats a huge issue as well. Too many people come out of high school with no practical knowledge or any idea of what they want in life __eou__ There should be a class that high school seniors have to take to better prepare them for entering the adult world. __eou__ Yes! My old school did have something like that, but it did little to nothing to prepare me. It's almost like they dont understand their own system.
Really..... I didn't know that. I do like video games though, they're fun! __eou__ They are very fun and they have a history that goes back as far as the early 1950s. __eou__ Really? I had no idea. What is you favorite game? __eou__ I'm old school, I like donkey kong! but I play a bunch of different ones since I like video games so much! __eou__ I used to play Sumer Mario Party be I haven't played much lately. Im thinking about getting a Nintendo switch. __eou__ Switches are awesome, I'm saving up for one but it's taking awhile since I work at mcdonalds. __eou__ I am probably going to get one for "my kids" for Christmas, but its really for me. haha __eou__ Haha thats great! I'm sure you can have alot of bonding time with them if you're having as much fun as they are! __eou__ They have never played the old school games I grew up with on my Nintendo and N64. What games will you get? __eou__ Definitely smash! and mario odyssey! __eou__ Those are all the best. I hope they come out with some of the other older ones as well.  __eou__ Me too! duck hunt would be great! __eou__ YES! And Spyro. Was that Nintendo? __eou__ No that was sony! haha
I agree purple is a beautiful color that can be light or bold __eou__ Yes there are lots of wonderful hues between red and violet on the charts __eou__ That reminds me. We had to learn about the light spectrum recently. Frankly, I am no fan of that science stuff. Too much to wrap my head around __eou__ I am always curious to understand things. But some things are better left unknown. __eou__ I'm more of an artsy type person. When painting pictures, I try to use purple as much as possible in a way that looks pleasing, such as a late sunset __eou__ Lovely! In Europe and the US, purple is always associated with royalty, magic and mystery. __eou__ That is one of the many reasons I love purple. My main reason for loving the color is that it gives me a calming sensation __eou__ I love it because it's such a royal color. It makes me feel like a queen. __eou__ If there is anything I should buy that comes in purple, I buy the purple one __eou__ Why not? Purple is the best color to be associated with! __eou__ I totally agree! I honestly surprised how few people like purple __eou__ There are a bunch of people that really don't! Bold colors aren't for everyone. __eou__ Maybe they would be better of with a pale purple, or even a dark color with a subtle purple hue. __eou__ Maybe they're better off with black.
Yes, but what is your opinion of it? What are your thoughts on the pracitce? __eou__ poaching was performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets. __eou__ Ouch. Wow. I suppose that is true though __eou__ Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools. __eou__ Yea, maybe they wont do it in the future __eou__ That's probably true, but who knows in this country. __eou__ Honestly, history seems to repeat itself here anyway __eou__ i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in . __eou__ Yea, kids are the future I guesss __eou__ i guess you are right  __eou__ We might be doomed then, lol __eou__ Lol, hopefully not __eou__ Seriously. I don’t think they’re learning what they need to learn in schools to keep the human race a thing.
i also like watching mystery movies __eou__ those are great . i watch them at times . __eou__ I like to drink green tea while watching the films! __eou__ Same, whats your favorite type? __eou__ Macha green tea! its sweet yet smooth! try it sometime! __eou__ O I had that alot over the summer while on vacation in Italy! __eou__ Thats awesome, I want to go on vacation to the countryside! I love to run to clear my head and it'd be great to do that in peace. __eou__ Awesome! I'm also an avid runner and I have olive skin so I never get burns haha! __eou__ Wow, I am so jealous, I get sunburns all the time. All of my friends and family say I have olive color'd eyes! __eou__ I've never heard of olive colored eyes haha! Speaking of green tea I have green eyes __eou__ Really? it's common in my family when we're younger. __eou__ Ah, interesting. My whole family has dark green eyes.  __eou__ How sweet! I guess familie's always have something in common! haha __eou__ haha yeah. well i gotta go, it was nice talking with you
Garth Brooks was always one of my favorites, but I enjoy George Strait a lot as well. __eou__ My mom loved George Strait. In 2009, country music was the most listened to music during rush hour. It's what I always tune in to while sitting in traffic. __eou__ Ye my mom was never a big  __eou__ Was never a big what? was that a typo? common mistake haha __eou__ haha ye i accidentally pressed enter. She was never a big garth brookes fan, always said i was dumpy for listening to him __eou__ I have always been an avid banjo player, country music has gotten me into it. I just enjoy listening to country music so much. __eou__ Oh that's awesome! I'm a big pianist, and I've got super long fingers so im quiet good at it haha! __eou__ I actually wanted to do it as a career but it never took off and now I have a crummy job at scrubway... __eou__ Aw that unfortunate. I heard scrubway has good benefits though __eou__ Well it has its perks, but its not as great as other places I could be working! __eou__ Ye I feel you, im stuck in a dead end job at an accounting firm __eou__ well atleast accounting jobs are usually high paying!  __eou__ Thats the only real benefit haha! __eou__ Well keep your chin up man! if you ever work up the nerve to leave hit me up!
I am very happy that Canada replied to Trump by increasing taxes on some us products. __eou__ yes it appears a trade war might happen now! __eou__ If that's the case, prepare for battle! __eou__ Lets take the topic away from politics for now. What are your thoughts on video games? Particularly RPGs? __eou__ They're a good way to escape from reality! Do you have a favorite? __eou__ Its so hard to pick a favorite. A good one I recently got into is called The Outer Worlds. It's similar to older Fallout games. __eou__ I don't play them much myself, but I like to watch YouTubers play the games. __eou__ Ah, I do that whenever I cant afford to buy a game. I just love the immersive storytelling the games can provide __eou__ I like watching the gameplays so I can watch it like a movie. My favorite is The Last of Us. __eou__ The Last of Us is TOTALLY like a movie! The emotion that the characters convey is so well done. __eou__ Right! I love what Ellen Page did with the character. __eou__ The actors did a fantastic job. I really want to play the sequel eventually. __eou__ I need to watch the story again. It's been so long, it would be like new. __eou__ If I could forget the game and go in blind again, I would
Yes, if only we could keep them that size and personality all of their lives __eou__ They have munchkin cats that stay pretty small. Either way, my kitten was extremely social for 2 weeks before she didn't need me to always hug her. She loves exploring. __eou__ I love kittens , especially when they head-but me  __eou__ Yes, kittens are sooo cute! There are actually more than 70 different breeds of cat! Do you know what breed your cat is? __eou__ I’ve got a black and white Bengal cat , they are so great . How about you ? __eou__ Mine is a simple domestic shorthair cat. What is your cats name? __eou__ My cat is named shadow , I only get to see him sporadically as I work in the military !  __eou__ What kind of job do you have in the military? My husband is a veteran.  __eou__ I work for the RAF , how long did he serve  __eou__ 11 years. He was in air traffic control in the AirForce.  __eou__ Wow , I aspire to work that long , i find it an extremely rewarding job  __eou__ Yes, it really does have its benefits. Even when you leave. He now works a 9-5 desk job though because air traffic was very high-stress.  __eou__ Interesting . It can definitely become exhausting . What about you , do you have a job L __eou__ I am on a leave of absence from my job because I just recently had a baby. But Yes, I work in retail as a manger.  __eou__ Nice talk 
It's one of my favourites! I wonder how you make it? __eou__ I think it involves a lot of nuts, sugar and eggs. __eou__ Yeah! baking is my hobby, everyone says that my pecan pie is the greatest they have ever had. __eou__ I'd love to try it haha! I really enjoy baking too but my big interest is building things, like furniture and bird houses __eou__ Thats interesting! well maybe you can come by on christmas! I always make several pecan pies for family and friends! It's also my birthday! __eou__ O that's awesome! Two parties in one day haha! I bet i could down 5 of your pecan pies! __eou__ How could you eat 5 pies!? __eou__ I'm super tall and have the metabolism of a Race horse LOL __eou__ I guess ill have to make extra! haha __eou__ Haha maybe you can send me one lolol __eou__ Hey! sure thing! any excuse to get me baking! __eou__ Maybe i can make you a chair or a birdhouse and send it to you as a gift for your Christmas birthday __eou__ That would be lovely, I love nature! __eou__ Me too, Im an avid bird watcher
my father is actually dr . pepper . __eou__ then you can be pepper md __eou__ i'm actually a college student __eou__ I'm a first year student myself. Huge fan of Harry Potter (the books specifcially)! What's your favorite book to read? __eou__ Awesome. My favorite book is The Citadel, it's a novel centered around medical ethics. __eou__ I've never heard of it myself but it sounds interesting for sure. What are you majoring in? __eou__ I'm majoring in Computer Science, you? __eou__ Business administration management. I was originally looking to study the field of virtual reality but figured this business admin may be a little more secured in terms of job availability. __eou__ Ohh. Virtual reality is amazing and will be huge in the future but I understand your decision. __eou__  agree completely but it still needs to be more mainstream for that to happen I feel. Not enough people are adopting it into their daily lives right now. __eou__ That __eou__ What made you want to get into computer science? __eou__ : I was always into technology and computers since I was a child, so naturally I wanted to do something related to that. __eou__ Always good to do something you love. Feels more like living your life than a job then!
Last night a shadowy figure was at my window. __eou__ Whoa, did you find out what it was? __eou__ No, but I think it saw me through the window! __eou__ Oh no! Thats terrifying. Do you have security cameras so you can see the activity? __eou__ No! I'm scared to leave the house now! __eou__ I'd be scared too! __eou__ What should I do? __eou__ Set a trap. Or maybe just a camera __eou__ Maybe call the police? __eou__ I would call the police if you don't feel safe. Maybe they can check it out for you.  __eou__ Or maybe I can check it out.. I'm going to go outside! __eou__ No way. I wouldn't do that. What if it comes inside? __eou__ Well, you only live once! I'm going to go do it! __eou__ haha do it!  Not like you'll be sleeping tonight anyway!
Yea, it was a little sad to realise that it was not normal. A good father-figure role is always needed. __eou__ Though less common in literature than evil stepmothers, there are also cases of evil "stepfathers was that your case? __eou__ He never really treated me like I was apart of the family. __eou__ Yeah some people are just like that. Stepfathers who are like this have a presence in literature but less common then the whole mean stepmother thing. __eou__ Very true! __eou__ My step farther ignored me for the most part , I see it as a blessing in disguise however ! Step father's am I right LOL  __eou__ Definitely the best way to look at it, a blessing in disguise. __eou__ I could never see myself considering anyone else apart from my real dad , may be old fashioned but that’s how it goes with me , what about you ? __eou__ My real dad wasn't really in the picture either then I got stuck with this goofball. __eou__ Aww I am sorry that your real dad wasnt there for you . It can be really tough to deal with  __eou__ Very much so! __eou__ I was lucky that my mum was like an angel . How about you ? __eou__ Most definitely!! The best mom ever! Just don't understand her choice in Men! LOL __eou__ How a women as amazing as my mum ended up with an ugly fat ‘ol’ drunk I’ll never know haha
I lost 20 lbs. __eou__ That's awesome. I just started working out. __eou__ I hardly work out. I mainly lost the weight by eating healthier and working hard at my job. I detail cars. __eou__ That will really help you to maintain your overall health. __eou__ A keto diet is what I am on. It's low carb, high fat, medium protein. High fat sounds bad, but the diet is actually one of the best. __eou__ I've heard that this diet is very effective in helping to lose weight.  You've proved it. __eou__ Its incredibly healthy. Although, the start of the diet is a little bumpy because you have to go through whats called a 'Keto Flu'. __eou__ That doesn't sound nice! Have you recovered from the Keto Flu yet? __eou__ Oh yeah, it lasts about a week or less. I've been on the diet for months now. __eou__ I admire your discipline.  Although, try not to overdo it with the weight loss. __eou__ The weight loss doesnt go too far on the diet anyway. Just gets rid of the weight you really dont need __eou__ There's nothing I love more than a doughnut after I've been in the studio.  Not sure I could keep it up for months like you! __eou__ The diet allows for a lot of variety. Bacon is actually a staple part of the diet if you are into that! __eou__ Yes, I'm definitely into bacon.  What food do you like?
hi ! ! i love animals . my eyes are blue , my dad died when i was 2 . __eou__ oh no , my father is alive and used to work for ge . __eou__ That’s nice. I was too young to remember anything, but my mom tells me stories about him all the time. __eou__ That's great that you're able to at least hear stories! I noticed you mentioning your love for animals.. What's your favorite? __eou__ Hmmm... I’d have to say giraffes. What’s yours? __eou__ That's a hard one. I'd say large cats like Lynx but any dogs come close second. __eou__ Lynx’s are neat animals. You said that dogs come close... do you own a dog? __eou__ I do yes! I have an Akita and Husky. Do you have any pets? __eou__ Yes. I have a dog as well. She’s a mix between a pug and beagle. She’s super sweet and rarely barks. Do you have any other pets besides Akita? __eou__ I love pugs. They are so loving. Aside from the Akita just the Husky I mentioned. She talks all the time and doesn't really know when to shut up haha. __eou__ They really are!! What is your favorite thing to do with your dogs? __eou__ Probably going out for walks or playing fetch. They are pretty large (80 ish lbs) so they have a ton of energy. How  about with yours? __eou__ That sounds nice. My dog is pretty old so she isn’t too playful. I mostly like to stay inside and cuddle with her.  __eou__ Nothing wrong with that either :) Having a cuddle buddy is always a plus.
It is not, I think they are a bunch of babies who cry about the internet.  __eou__ It was formed by Ulrich, one of the best drummers out there.  Metallica is not mine either but I have read a lot about different types of bands, including Metallica. __eou__ so what is your favorite band? __eou__ I think Metallica is one of my favorites. __eou__ Oh I see, Well I'm into more upbeat music, like pop, or rap something that helps me set a good pace when I go running. __eou__ Metallica can actually be pretty upbeat. But yea rap is also good for exercise. __eou__ if I were to listen to a Metallica song to add my playlist which one would you reccomend?  __eou__ Master of puppets 100%. It's a classic and very good to run to. __eou__ ok , awesome! Thank you . I will defintley be checking it out. I am always looking for new music to add. __eou__ Sweet. What's your favorite meal to eat? I always love chicken and rice. __eou__ I actually like sea food. so Crab legs, sushi, ,fish. things like that __eou__ That sounds delicious. I'm more of a chicken guy but the sushi from japan specifically looks so good __eou__ Yes, have you ever been to Japan? __eou__ no i've not , i always wanted to travel around there though .
i wish i did i have kids though __eou__ i used to have 6 kats but don't hav them no mor __eou__ I started selling clothes on facebook to make money on the side __eou__ Wow, thats a great side buisness. I used to make toys for the 6 cats i used to own and I sold extras online! __eou__ that's fantastic to hear, my husband the pastor loves to shop online. __eou__ Your husband is a pastor? I would appreciate it if he could pray for me...I had a headache so bad that I had to call 911 __eou__ we will but in the mean time browser my store on facebook so we can be both saved. __eou__ Definitely! we can help eachother. __eou__ praise Jesus and pass the ammunition!!! __eou__ Rightly said! ammunition always comes in handy! __eou__ as a great business idea you should model your cats with the toys to make more money __eou__ Wow! thanks for the idea! thats so smart! __eou__ thank you I found the idea by doing it on my wn clothing site to boost sales __eou__ You must have a real entrepenerial spirit! im impressed!
I am very disappointed in myself. I failed my driving test today for the second time. Can't get a car as i need a license __eou__ Oh no, I am so sorry. How long do you have to wait to take it again? __eou__ Just till after Yoga. __eou__ how long do you have to wait to take the test again? __eou__ I only have to wait until tomorrow. __eou__ That's not bad. I hope it goes well.  __eou__ Me too. I'm hoping the class beforehand will keep me calm and mindful. What are you going to be up to? __eou__ It is suppose to rain so I will probably stay home. I may go to the library to return some books. __eou__ That sounds really cozy. You going to pick up anything when you go to the library? __eou__ No just return books. I am going to adopt a dog very soon though. __eou__ Thats great! What breed? __eou__ A lab mix I hope __eou__ That would be nice. Those are so sweet. __eou__ Agree! My mother who was a nurse is going to help me pick one out. Do you have a pet?
Well I just got a call telling me I have gotten the job.  I got a new job! __eou__ Congratulations! I hope you lovve it __eou__ Thanks! It's in Germany so I have to move. Luckily I already speak the language. __eou__ Ive never had a job in another country. Surely its nerve racking? __eou__ I'm a little nervous but I'm sure I'll be fine. __eou__ Relax and be yourself! I wonder what the weather is like there __eou__ People are always asking me that... "How's the weather up there?" *sigh*... __eou__ Is it usually cloudy in Germany? That's what I have always heard. __eou__ I'm not really sure, I guess I'll find out when I get there! Where are you from? __eou__ Im from the USA. The summers here are always sunny and hot. I wonder how summers are there... Summer's my favorite. __eou__ Do you like any sports? I play basketball. __eou__ I used to like sports, but I dont play them anymore. I dont have the physical coordination for it __eou__ Sorry to hear that. What else do you like to do? __eou__ Might sound weird, but I like listening to classic radio programs. The old stuff fascinates me
I've heard of them but haven't listened to their music. __eou__ Theyre great, they are an American heavy metal band and really pushed metal into the light of the general public and help make it a huge genre. __eou__ Have you ever seen them live? __eou__ Unfortunately not , money is tight at the moment ! It’s a massive dream of mine however !   __eou__ It's crazy and worth it for sure! I've only seen them once in Nashville but I'd say it was the best show I've ever been to. __eou__ Wow that sounds great , must be a really exhilarating experience, congratulations! Planning on seeing anyone else in the future ? __eou__ I do plan on going to Washington DC on New Years to see Skrillex. Different genre but still a good show! __eou__ What that’s amazing , although my favourite DJ is marshmello  __eou__ I love Marshmello! I got to see him at EDC and he put on a great show. __eou__ You’ve seen a lot , how many concerts have you actually been to ? __eou__ Honestly hard to say but I would guess 200+ if you included all the acts at festivals ect. __eou__ I’ve been some at the local club , what’s the best concert you’ve ever been to ? __eou__ Club shows aren't bad at all; Best I'd say was Lost Lands Festival this year. __eou__ Clubs are so fun! Any specific ones in mind? I’m hoping I can save up and go soon

It's gonna be a busy week! __eou__ How long do they typically visit for? I wish I had a family that visited me. __eou__ They usually stay for a little less than a week. You should invite some of them over if you can! __eou__ I would if I knew who my parents were. I don't know if I ever told you this but I'm an orphan. __eou__ I am very sorry. Then I would say to make your friends your family in a way.  __eou__ that would make you my family then! I'm okay with that. __eou__ I wouldn't have it any other way! So what are your plans this week? __eou__ have a sick gig spinning some tracks at jimmies then a quick tinder coffee date. Where are you taking your family out to?   __eou__ I think we're just going to have a real nice dinner with everyone. That way we can all catch up. Good luck on that date! __eou__ It's always nice to bond with the family! I'll tell you all the details later! __eou__ You better! I think I'm gonna hit the gym later. You still a member? __eou__ Nah. I decided to start working on my cardio.

We write letters to newspapers, campaign, some go to the extreme of boycotting, or rallies. __eou__ what is your favorite thing to write about? __eou__ Most likely daily acts of protest would be great for me. __eou__ so what did you go to school for/ __eou__ I'm in school for computer science, you? __eou__ Early child hood development. __eou__ Wow. A very noble major. Do you read novels by any chance? __eou__ at times when i can squeeze some reading in, but I am currently looking for something new to read. Any suggestions? __eou__ I recently read salvage the bones. It's a novel that follows an african american family as the prepared for hurricane katrina and also the aftermath __eou__ I will have to look for that one, I lived in Louisiana shortly after Katrina and would love to read anything related to that subject. __eou__ I'm also very interesting in american politics. particularly pertaining to the upcoming presidential election  __eou__ There is definitley alot of opinions and information for one to absorb , when it comes to that topic, but its very important to stay current. __eou__ Did you vote in the last election with Donald Trump and Hillary the Senator from New York.

What do you do? __eou__ I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. __eou__ Yeah i have heard. I wanna make more cheese...LOL and that is actually my favorite type of food. What about you? __eou__ My favorite foods are pizza and lasagna. Both involve cheese __eou__ Oh yeah.I love those foods as well. I love to have some wine and cheese after horseback riding. I love to ride horses. __eou__ I could never get into horse riding. The riding is too bouncy and uncomfortable for me __eou__ Your not the first person to say that and you won't be the last. __eou__ My fiance loves horse riding, which makes me wish I could do it more, but alas, I cannot. Too hard on my back __eou__ Yes. My brother has the same problem. He has herniated discs. __eou__ Ouch, I bet that is very painful __eou__ It is and he does lots of therapy and pain management. __eou__ Its good he has such good care __eou__ Take care. Nice chatting with you.
Good Morning, for my job I review candidates and the one I had recently was far and away the best one I have ever interviewed __eou__ That is great, did you offer them the job? __eou__ absolutley , I feel the best candidates are those that you can learn from. __eou__ I completely agree. How old are you? I'm 25 __eou__ I am 33  __eou__ I work as a truck repairman __eou__ Oh really? how do you like it? __eou__ it's great I was always into trucks even as a child so it's my dream job __eou__ do you have to get up early? I am definitley not a morning person. __eou__ Yup. I'm up everyday at 4am, It's not that bad if you just set a schedule and stay with it. __eou__ true. I need to just get to bed earlier , i tend to stay up too late. __eou__ Yea. All about discipline, it's not easy __eou__ I useto work early, but as i get older i find it harder to  __eou__ I'm the exact opposite actually. As a teen i hated being up early but as i get older I want to more haha
i love my parents to death we grew up poor, but we always had all the basic stuff needed for school and clothing __eou__ Your parents sound like wonderful people! __eou__ Yeah those two gals gave me quite the push to win in life! __eou__ My parents also raised me well and were always around, I feel bad for children who suffered from neglect due to various things like substance abuse, unemployment, etc. __eou__ you're right. I wish I had more time to help out kids in need like that. We should totally volunteer as big brothers! __eou__ Yes, that sounds like a great idea!

Friends for life. __eou__ remember the first time we met?  __eou__ Yep, I sure do. We sure had a lot of fun back then. __eou__ what was the name of the game we used to play? The one where my mothers would get super upset at? I'm having trouble remembering

I love the product but the whole theory thing is a struggle for me. __eou__ Is that a hard class? what is the idea of the class? __eou__ It's not so much difficult as it is tedious. It's basically the rules of music. It's a lot of term memorization and whatnot. __eou__ Oh wow ive never heard of the class but it sounds interesting. I love music but never had a in dept look into it __eou__ It is very interesting. I think I would find it more interesting if it wasn't such an early class!

Why do you want to take a gap year? __eou__ It is pretty common now the gap year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull to allow students more time to grow as a person __eou__ I'm thinking of taking a year off myself to find some work. Really needing to get my first car. Taking the bus everywhere is terrible! __eou__ Public transportation is better for the planet and gives you time to read though.  It is hard to do some things though. __eou__ I agree completely about the benefits but it is hard when it comes to going longer distances. __eou__ That's true.

I do enjoy swimming during the summer months to cool off, but don't think I would do well competitively. __eou__ practice can always help . but i'm sure competition might be intimidated . __eou__ Maybe I'll give it a go next year. I am quite busy with marching band practice at times. __eou__ Oh, cool! I did marching percussion in high school. It's more challenging because you have to move while playing!
what kind of birds are you seeing? __eou__ There are many kinds of parrots and toukons. I love watching them recreationally.

I just finished my last exam and am very relieved to be finished! __eou__ Congrats! That is always a great feeling. __eou__ Thank you!

Marketing is very lucrative! __eou__ It should be.

Chihuahaus might be the only living creatures that still like Jared Leto.

We take lots of road trips! It's a lot of fun!  __eou__ I bet. What's the best trip you've taken, or place you've been to? __eou__ Oh... I'd say the best trip was the one to Colorado.

I really don't know how to respond when you tell me stuff like that.
Its among the top recreational activities and great exercise too. __eou__ Do you have a favorite stroke you like to practice?  Butterfly, backstroke, for instance? __eou__ I enjoy doing the butterfly. Makes me feel alive! I also get to show off in front of my family. __eou__ I think the Butterfly is the hardest stroke, it takes a lot of practice to get it right.  __eou__ Yes but once you master it, you feel like a swimming pro. __eou__ I'm sure it is a great exercise. What are your plans for later today? __eou__ Watching a movie with the girlfriend. We're finally getting around to the see joker.  __eou__ That sounds like fun. I love actually going to the movie theater to watch new movies. __eou__ What new movie are you seeing? ugh I just remembered my parents are serving vegetables tonight. I hate vegetables. __eou__ I think I might go see the new Zombieland, seems fitting for Halloween.

Zombieland looks cool, I hope you enjoy it! __eou__ Thanks! I hope you and your girlfriend enjoy Joker. Maybe get some popcorn and some chocolate milk for the show! __eou__ I have a big jug of chocolate milk I'm going to try to sneak in. hopefully nobody catches me.  __eou__ If they do just pretend to do the butterfly right out of the theater. That will throw them off. __eou__ micheal phelps would be so proud of us.
Someone hit a coworker's car in the parking lot, and everyone came together to chip in for the deductible. __eou__ That was so nice of them to do such a thing. __eou__ It really was.  It wasn't their fault and they needed the car to get to work. __eou__ I hope I work with nice people like that one day. The people I work with are self centered. __eou__ That's too bad.  What kind of things do they do? __eou__ They onlt do for themselves unless they are asked to help.

I have thought about making further changes to my diet. Has it helped? __eou__ Definitely! My health got better and I feel better in general. __eou__ That's great to hear! Maybe I will put some more thought into giving it a try myself __eou__ You need to be sure that it's a well balanced diet so you get all the nutrients you need. __eou__ That's what has left me hesitant because I'm concerned I won't be able to get everything I need __eou__ Well if you eat right you can reduce the risk of disease like heart disease. __eou__ I try to make good choices but they aren't always plant based __eou__ Just do your best!

I will probably go to the same stylist. __eou__ That can get expensive.  I color my hair to hide the gray.  I can't afford to highlight and get rid of gray :) __eou__ I know many people who get their hair dyed and do it themselves for a cost effective measure. __eou__ I've considered it, but I'm scared I would mess it up. __eou__ There is always a first time for everything.

I've never seen it. Who do you think should star in the remake if they do one? __eou__ Vivien Leigh  played the original Scarlett and I think Angelina Jolie would be perfect. Or even Scarlet Joanson __eou__ I think Scarlet Joanson would be perfect __eou__ Agreed! We have been seeing a lot of remakes recently. What do you think of them? __eou__ Some of them are alright, but I prefer movies that are new stories  __eou__ New is nice. All of the series and whatnot lately has seemed a little stale to me as well __eou__ Precisely. It seems all that Disney is doing anymore is remakes and sequels, when was the last new movie that was a new story? __eou__ I couldn't tell you. Not just Disney. Star Wars this, Marvel that, etc. Can we see some creativity out of Hollywood? __eou__ Same __eou__ And by creativity I am not saying taking "reality tv" and the Kardashians to the big screen. __eou__ Yeah.

It's terrible what plastic is doing to our oceans so i just want to do my part __eou__ iIts not just oceans but rivers,forests,lakes. Its really something that needs more attention. __eou__ Completely agree. Plastic bags from stores are a huge issue. I only use paper bags to carry things __eou__ Yes, that really helps but not everyone takes it as serious as us. If i couldi would just carry the items to my car everytime lol. __eou__ Beats supporting the plastic industry lol __eou__ Seriously!

Maybe get them an audio book to put them to sleep XD __eou__ I prefer to read to and with them. NOTHNG is more important than people. __eou__ That's very good.

I have made some money on side by editting various mediums. __eou__ He does not pay me for editing, but I get sneak peaks and several FREE books. We do have a great relationship. __eou__ Free books is a great perk. Is he your only child? __eou__ No, I have 3. Sadly for me the oldest is in eternity. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that! I don't have any kids yet, hoping someday I will though __eou__ There is no greater joy than children. Enjoy someone else's until you are blessed with your own.
I was angry on my son. __eou__ Aww!  Why? __eou__ He beat up his sister! I never know how to handle these situations. I don't want to use violence against violence __eou__ Have you considered sending him to timeout? That would be a way to punish him without being violent with him __eou__ He's a bit too old for timout. Grounding him doesn't really seem to work either __eou__ How old is he? __eou__ He's 14 and his sister is 12. They've really been jerks to each other lately __eou__ I'm sorry you're having such a hard time with them. Beating up a sibling is a serious issue. You should find a way to punish him somehow. __eou__ Do you have kids? I'm just not used to this kind of conflict. I was never like this with my sister growing up so I'm not sure what to do __eou__ I don't have kids. I've only got two cats. They fight, but I'm not sure that dealing with conflict among pets qualifies me to offer parenting advice.  __eou__ Maybe I should get a spray bottle and squirt them when they fight haha __eou__ It works for my cats! __eou__ maybe the simpleist and silliest solution will work
I cheated on a Spanish test in High school. __eou__ did you get caught __eou__ No, but I also didn't learn Spanish! __eou__ I did the same thing. It's too hard to learn at an older age. Especially when it's a mandatory school thing instead of an actual thing you WANT to learn. __eou__ And most highschool language teachers are utter garbage. The pace isn't fast enough and there's not enough immersion. __eou__ True, although I don't know about it not being fast enough. I think in my case it was too fast. Going from 'hola' to complex sentences in like two days __eou__ Yeah, there's a balance to be sure. They also have you learn dumb things, like "where is the library" instead of basic conversation, like "I'm hungry" __eou__ True. Not sure who exactly would be looking for a library in another language. Maybe if it's like a famous landmark in Spain or something, but otherwise it's useless __eou__ There are a lot of great tools for learning languages now. Apps and such __eou__ For sure. I don't know that I'll ever get around to actually ever using one. Might need some incentive, like a spouse who speaks it __eou__ What language would you like to learn? __eou__ Probably Spanish would be the most useful since it's the second most common here. Otherwise, French would be cool because it's more rare and romantic. Hah __eou__ I'd like to learn Italian, that's my ancestry, even though I have long blonde hair, lol __eou__ Oh, Italian is good, too. Kinda similar to Spanish though, so if you had hard time with that, Italian won't be much easier probably.
I am ignorant to much of the world aside from my exposure through the internet. That's amazing though, I would believe it. Cherry Blossoms are my favorite flower by far.

It had been raining every day but we were lucky and it was the only day that week that it didn't rain! __eou__ I recently went to a wedding in the middle of a thunderstorm. I felt so bad for the bride! __eou__ Oh my gosh. Was it an outdoor wedding? __eou__ It was indoors, but the reception was at a different venue than the wedding so the wedding party and all the guests had to be out in the storm __eou__ That would be very unpleasant __eou__ It wasn't ideal. But the rest of the day was lovely. Happy couple, good food, good dancing __eou__ That's good that they were able to make the most of it! Weddings can be really fun as long as everyone is in good spirits __eou__ Yes! I agree __eou__ I was just in a wedding last weekend and everyone had a great time dancing
Recently I was sitting outside relaxing with a drink in my backyard and just felt quite at peace with things and enjoyed the nice weather. __eou__ i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too __eou__ nature can make you feel at peace __eou__ There is nothing better than a warm day with a glass of tea in one hand and a good book in the other __eou__ I can agree only if you add a good movie in that equasion __eou__ I like a good movie, but I love a good book. I love books so much I even work in a store that buys and sells sed books. __eou__ I have an older brother who works in a bookstore! __eou__ I hope he enjoys it as much as I do. __eou__ I work in bookstore as well, and i must say.

I do not enjoy anything scary. __eou__ What type of books do you like to read? __eou__ Mostly the Bible.
I had no idea there was even a science dedicated to mushrooms! Do you know why mushrooms taste so good? __eou__ Well Edible mushrooms are usually cooked and consumed for their nutritional value, Most people dont like the taste, It just depends on how you cook them.  __eou__ I find they're always best if mixed in with something and not just plain. __eou__ I like to saute them in butter with some onions __eou__ Have you ever tried them on pizza? __eou__ Yes! I like them on Pizza, along with roasted peppers __eou__ Sounds great! First time trying them was when my mother started working at the bank. __eou__ I work in a bank myself! __eou__ That's so cool. I'm thinking about doing the same soon. Do you like it? __eou__ I like it a lot, but then I really enjoy being nice and courteous to people __eou__ Same here. Do you think working at a credit union and a traditional bank are the same? __eou__ Probably similar, but a credit union might be less corporate, which could be good. __eou__ I think that's the route I'm going to take. As long as I'm helping people, I'm happy. __eou__ I would hire you if you applied to my bank!
i wish i'd have become a nurse . your jobs are in demand . __eou__ i do love to read on my free time . what do you like ? __eou__ i don't have any free time to read, i wish i could!

You deserve a raise! I hope it is. I hear it's cold this time of year. __eou__ yup. very cold. wish it was warmer here. :( __eou__ I hate the cold! But out of season trips are cheap! When are you going to take your vacation?  __eou__ about a week from November 6. but i would had to gaet back on athe 7th to help with the Doctor on heart surgery.  __eou__ oh geez. that's not fair!  __eou__ it get's very busy, good news is i get off on on the 10th and the 1th. so, i'll just relax and read my book called "Shiver Me Tember" 
i got home from work today and found someone stole my tv __eou__ oh wow.. that stinks __eou__ the police dept could not help me fine out what happened. __eou__ When things like this happen I find it helpful to remember how insignificant we are in the big scheme of things. __eou__ But I need to feel that my home is safe and I can feel secure. __eou__ You should think about getting a security system. I got one after my moms house was broken into. __eou__ Its  like the meat that I eat I have to know that it is safe. __eou__ Well that was a strange direction but ok. I really like having a security system. I recommend it __eou__ I also like to feel safe when I go to hear my favorite band safety is very important to me so I will consider a system __eou__ I'm not sure what your favorite band has to do with your security system. __eou__ Do you have a contract on you security system? __eou__ Yes.

I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him. __eou__ My father has a pocket knife that he inherited from my great grandfather. Are any of your husband's knives family heirlooms? __eou__ Yes, It goes with the rest of the stuff.    It's a rifle he hunted with, and my father hunted with.  Now I've got it. __eou__ How neat. What's your favorite type of hunting? __eou__ I'm an outdoorsman.  I hunt or fish for half of the meat I eat each year. __eou__ Wow. That's really impressive. I've been turkey hunting, but I don't hunt enough to provide much food
Who coined the word sleep? __eou__ Dr. S.A. Kinnier Wilson coined the term. Sleep has REMs which is a mode which allow the body to rest or sleep in deeper states __eou__ I am so glad we can sleep.

This party is going to be great! __eou__ I'd rather not have a party. I like to keep things intimate. __eou__ I suppose we don't need a magician then. Should i cancel the keg order?  __eou__ Nah keep the keg. Beer and the pool boy will be a great combination __eou__ oh god. I remember last time.

Broke my legs and one arm. It was horrible __eou__ That sounds horrible. I hope you were able to recover completely and have no permanant issues.  __eou__ Sadly not, don't have full movement in one arm and I still walk with a limp as my leg never healed properly. Happy to be alive though! __eou__ Yes, better than the alternative. I see scary wrecks all the time and i cringe. I lost a good friend in a motorcycle accident. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that.

Do you play the guitar? __eou__ I do, though not very well.  I like to improvise.  I'm better at coming up with my own tunes than playing something known. __eou__ Practice makes perfect. I couldnt even begin to try. I cant play any instruments but I love to sing. __eou__ I wish I could sing.  I try to write songs and it would be helpful to be able to sing what I write. __eou__ I like writing songs also and poetry. I recently started a novel. __eou__ Wow!

i want a dog i might go to the shelter and get one soon __eou__ and i have one dog and a few cards __eou__ Is it worth keeping a dog? __eou__ I meant cats. Sorry my son is distracting me. I think having a dog is such a joy but a lot of work too. __eou__ I've never owned pets, but want to try new things, sounds like getting a dog maight be a good idea then __eou__ I'm glad to hear you want to adopt from the shelter. Saving a dog is so rewarding. __eou__ I sure hope so I want to do something that matters even if it is only in the life of a dog that needs a home __eou__ Consider adopting an adult dog. They are most often looked over at shelters and end up being put down. Plus they are usually more well behaved. __eou__ Thats a good idea! My main hesitation is the responsibility for another life, but an adult dog will probably be more self-sufficient than a puppy __eou__ yes and normally already potty trained! __eou__ That would be great since I will want a low maintainence breed of dog __eou__ I would suggest one with short hair so you do not have to deal with grooming.  __eou__ I should head down to the shelter to see if I can find a nice older short-haired dog __eou__ Good idea. I hope you can find your new best friend!

This includes driving and non driving responsibilities. __eou__ Well that seems a bit complicated.

I don't drive any more but I love the lifestyle. I still get to talk to drivers and smell the exhaust. __eou__ Oh wow, that's a cool job. Do you ever get cramped up from driving?

I have only found it about 2 months ago. It's on the Syfy cable network. If you like Sifi or Horror films it's defiantly work watching. __eou__ I like both of those genres. I think I will check them out.  __eou__ i definitely recommend it . what do you like to do for fun ? __eou__ I like long walks on the beach.  __eou__ my favorite thing to do is shopping , but the beach is also fantastic ! __eou__ I love to eat also. I want some lamb chops. __eou__ Oh now you're just making me hungry!  I like lamb chops as well.   __eou__ Or maybe some crab legs and yellow rice! __eou__ What is your favorite restaurant?  I prefer eating at home, but take out works.  
When I was trying to get pregnant a few years back, my 15 year old cousin accidentally got knocked up. __eou__ Oh no, was you able to get pregnant? __eou__ I wasn't and I kinda happy I didn't. __eou__ Why do you feel that way? __eou__ Well, my cousin's life has been messed up since she had the baby and my mother, she's a retired teacher, has been trying to help her. __eou__ Do you think that you will try to get pregnant again? __eou__ Yes, now that I'm married and older, I do want to have a child. __eou__ That's good.

Too much MSG. __eou__ then it'll be good for me too __eou__ Yeah, I've been trying to recycle more and use eco friendly products.    __eou__ Think everyone needs to make a huge effort for the environment __eou__ I agree.

You should move down there if so, the best Mexican food is probably down there. __eou__ Do you like Mexican style foods? __eou__ I love Mexican food! __eou__ Mexican is delicious.

I guess school and stress just gets to people sometimes. __eou__ Yeah it can be more than a normal temporary reaction to life events. Although I try to keep perspective like a lot of people struggle with this and worse problems. __eou__ I know. Just hard to believe that my roommate would be rummaging through my things. I wonder if she has been stealing from me? __eou__ its totally possible. Did you get to find out why she did that? __eou__ I haven't spoken with her about it yet. I just caught her on video going through my desk. How do you bring something like that up? __eou__ definitely possible __eou__ I don't like confrontation, and this is not a discussion I am looking forward to having. But I have to stand up for myself. __eou__ have you tried confronting her? __eou__ I tried to bring it up yesterday but she was in a hurry to get out the door. __eou__ i'd suggest you find a time you're sure she's not going out and talk about it __eou__ I know. I just need to set a time and sit down and do it. Hope for the best. Maybe there is a reason? __eou__ yeah. i like to give a person benefit of the doubt. Maybe there's a reason,like you said.

I cant swim so a boat is out of the question for me.  __eou__ Ah, I see. Fishing seems so relaxing and the people who fish, whom I've meet are always so nice. What kind of fish do you catch? __eou__ Catfish mostly, sometimes white trout, but my best catch was a shark. Not like a huge one but one of the small kinds.  __eou__ Wow, that shark must have been hard to reel in? __eou__ Yeah I had to have someone with me to put it in the net. At first I thought that my hook had caught on a rock or something.  __eou__ Wow, quite a story to tell. I love catfish, go out to Cracker Barrel twice a month for it. __eou__ I have not been there in so long. I could eat some of their chicken and dumplings.

So no more till death do us part. You marry someone, then your personalities clash and you are no longer compatible. Seems a cop out to me. __eou__ Well, to answer your first question, I have been married for 21 years and never divorced, but I agree with you, people often "cop out". __eou__ they certainly do, sometime they just don't want to be in a relationship anymore. __eou__ Thats unfortunate but it does happen.

A few years ago after a divorce, my roommates moved away and I gotta tell you, it was rough after that. __eou__ I am sorry, that sounds rough __eou__ It was. The only plus side was that it got me away from their dog. __eou__ I have a very similar experience. Just after I was divorced, I tried the roommate thing. I felt empty when they left. I know what you're going through. __eou__ Yea being alone is tough. Luckily theres is pizza though, am I right? __eou__ Pizza is amazing. There's nothing I love more than banging on some Hendrix and eating some fine pizza. __eou__ DON't FORGET THE BEERS! __eou__ I hear you! But when I get buzzed, I just want to rock out on my guitar.

I think my rhymes are pretty tight __eou__ Any songs you like to sample or use bass lines from while you rap? __eou__ Thats the thing, everythings original for the most part. The beat that find, the hook, everything. I only made on and spit over it, the rest somebody else made.  __eou__ Maybe we could jam at some point? I'm only a beginner though...

I think people today don't take marriage as serious as it should be taken. __eou__ I agree. I understand when 2 people have given it their all and it doesn't work, but thats not usually the case. __eou__ I totally agree for you. Marriage isn't easy.  Takes hard work.   __eou__ But its has the best outcome. 
No I haven't, honestly the thought of putting my hands in other people's mouths for a living grosses me out. If I did though I would definitely want to become an orthodontist. __eou__ Have you ever wanted to live in another country?  There are a number of dental school in various countries around the world. I bet some areas of the world really need dentists.  __eou__ I've thought of living in another country, but the thought of being a dentist really grosses me out __eou__ Yeah i wish i could be a baseball player. __eou__ That sounds like it would be fun.

Magic Kingdom has the big castle right __eou__ Yeah but its just a photo op and a walkway. You cant go inside.  __eou__ And here I always thought you could. That's kind of a bummer. I've seen they decorate for Halloween though too
What training do you need? __eou__ A lot of it is about having a high visibility presence so that people don't even TRY any crap with you! You want to always be on the lookout for signs of crime.... __eou__ That makes sense. Vigilance is a great preventative.  __eou__ I am a security guard so it is very important. __eou__ Are you concerned that you are going to be replaced with a security robot? I listened to a great 99% Invisible about them plus a documentary called Chopping Mall. __eou__ I have never thought of that. I just finished training so I should be ok for a few years. __eou__ Yeah I think you've got a lot of time. I worry about AI. I don't think that it'll be like Star Wars at all. __eou__ I think in the long run it will benefit society but there will be some issues along the way.  __eou__ There are just going to be tons of lost jobs and AI often has so much bias built in from the coding and learning process. __eou__ Yeah that could be an issue. How do you think governments and people can prepare? __eou__ we need to regulate the jobs that can be automated, we need a robust UBI and social safety net, and companies need to be much more careful about developing them. __eou__ That definitely makes a lot of sense.  __eou__ Otherwise we're going to all be at home playing video games all day. I love games as much as the next person, but I want to do something. __eou__ I like games to. It is a nice distraction in my off time. I play during the day sometimes because I work nights.

My wife does the more unusual animals for us. __eou__ Whats your favorite animal to train? __eou__ I enjoy training any service animals, they do such great work and live such happy lives. __eou__ They are very important and very cool __eou__ THank you!

My dad isn't very nice when he's mad __eou__ Ah well, he raised your and your brother so he knows what hes doing. I am married so I understand sibling antics  with kids __eou__ Yea, it's rough having siblings. They take so much attention away and make things harder. __eou__ My favorite color is blue, I think I will be something that color for Halloween __eou__ You could be a smurf! Or Sonic the Hedgehog! __eou__ Omg that is such a great idea... You made my day. __eou__ Yay! I think I'll be a dragon. I've always wanted to breathe fire. __eou__ That would be very cool.  Dragon actually means water snake in Latin. I am married so what could my husband be, Gargamel from the Smurfs __eou__ Gargamel or Gargamel's cat would be good. Oooo, maybe I'll be a water dragon! __eou__ I bet a  water dragon would be a win win for a costume contest. __eou__ Yea, I just wish I had thought of it earlier so I could make it myself. __eou__ The best would be making it my favorite color blue, now that would be awesome
i usually do not go anywhere . i do like cold weather , howver __eou__ however what is wrong with cold weather and you ? __eou__ I grew up in Mississippi so I am used to it being hot __eou__ I understand that, usually in cold whether I stay in home watching YouTube videos __eou__ What kind do you like to watch __eou__ Mostly gaming videos and movies trailers you know __eou__ Do you play any video games yourself or do you just enjoy watching them __eou__ Kinda bit of both, sometimes I write on my spare time __eou__ That sounds interesting. How did you get into that? __eou__ Basically just thoughts that pop up in my head and I write them down __eou__ The most writing that I do is making a note in my iPhone and then forgetting about it for 5 months.  __eou__ Its like this, when I have a lot of stuff written down I revise them to see if I can make a story out of it __eou__ Do you think it is something that you would want to make a career out of one day? __eou__ I have thought though but I think I wait until I'm fully confident to dive it in you know?

I could see something getting filmed out there. All you have to do is pitch it to the right person. ;) __eou__ That's true. The trouble is knowing the right person. Hahaha. __eou__ Yea, it's tough to start finding that. I usually just go through social media until I get a good lead. __eou__ That sounds like a plan for sure.

I think being single has taken a toll on my mental health. __eou__ In my experience, when you stop looking, that's when you find someone. __eou__ I hope that's the case.

I mainly use it for art/crafts projects. Painting wood signs, etc... __eou__ Fun! Acrylic is great because is water soluble, but once it's dry is it also water resistant. It's so versatile.

Just 5 in total. I may move out near a park to try to get a job... __eou__ Fresh open air is always better than sitting behind a desk all day I would say. And there are always new things to see! __eou__ Thats very true. Life on a farm has me used to freedom, I dont think I could go back to something not as free. __eou__ I can imagine that, once you have tasted the fresh air it is hard to go back to something else. I am all for country living, more room! __eou__ Maybe this was a sign? the climate was changing anyway so maybe it was time to get out?
Do you have any animals? I just had to put mine down __eou__ Oh my goodness, I'm sorry! I have a dog and two cats. __eou__ Thank you. My cat was pretty old for a cat, 20.

I think the hairless cats look kind of neat. __eou__ yes, you are right ! __eou__ I suppose a plus to having a hairless cat would be not having to worry about the hair getting into everything. __eou__ very true . maybe i will have to get a cat too . __eou__ They sure do make for good pets, if you get one with a good temperament. I had one that only liked me when I fed him. __eou__ True, they are good human companions though. I actually tried to do that once, but my cat was not feeling that! __eou__ Some of them have the biggest personalities! __eou__ I most definitely think they're personalities are different. I had no idea there were more than 70 cat breeds!
I was born there, but don't remember it. __eou__ Oh ok, that's cool! It's the 4th most populous city in Texas __eou__ I still like bats, though :D __eou__ haha bats are pretty neat as long as they dont get too close to me __eou__ They're adorable!

The crowd gets crazy! __eou__ Yeah, those crowds get crazy. I wouldn't take a Bowie knife because I work out a lot. I really want to be a football player when I grow up.  __eou__ You could probably take down a mob if needed.haha __eou__ I did attend a One Direction show with a Bowie knife once...it was after I drank 16 protein shakes. __eou__ You were ready for a WWE show! __eou__ I think WWE wrestling is great practice for my future career in the NFL! __eou__ You would be great offense and definitely defense! __eou__ What about you? Do you want to be a WWE wrestler name Bowie Knife?
I had no roommate my first year of freshman year of college which got quite old __eou__ ok how did you manage the situation? __eou__ I just had to deal with. There were a lot of lonely days but I made it. __eou__ I think I would like some alone time, as long as I could stay busy filming __eou__ The positive of living alone is that I was able to decorate however. I painted the walls purple, my favorite color. __eou__ Really, purple is a lovely color. Much better than black, which reminds me of death __eou__ I know what you mean.

Maybe somewhere near the beach. __eou__ I love the beach, we can get there using a train __eou__ Yes, ease of access is one of the perks of living in a coastal area. __eou__ i like books about trains too __eou__ Interesting.  Since you seem to like trains - did you know there is a band called iLIKETRAiNS?  They're an English rock group. __eou__ they cound really cool!

One i've never heard before. __eou__ I guess I like philosophy when I'm not being comedic __eou__ You certainly do have an interesting combination of hobbies! __eou__ Well variety is the spice of life. Pizza, beer, philosophy, comedy 
I do too...he was the first one to advocate for higher salaries for workers. __eou__ And it was a well manged company, I can't imagine how tough it would have been to survive the great depression. __eou__ It would have been much easier if he was a Ford Truck Man! __eou__ Ford is what made him famous! Also, Ford have a 8% stake in Aston Martin too? __eou__ That's incredible. If I had a stake that large, only my three ex-wives would benefit.  __eou__ I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too ! __eou__ I wish I had a net worth of just $20! Divorces are very expensive.  __eou__ They are! My mom sometimes jokes that she should have gotten an annulment to make their marriage null and void, but I don't think she means it. __eou__ At least I have my fancy Ford truck. It gets me where I need to go. __eou__ They do have really good body styles. __eou__ The towing capacity is fantastic. Pulls all my marriage baggage no problem! __eou__ That's funny st least you can laugh about it. __eou__ Yes, my first ex wife took a baseball bat to my pretty little four wheel drive truck.  __eou__ Why was she angry?
When I was a child I was terrified of the basement. __eou__ That's unfortunate. What made you so scared of it? __eou__ its just so dark i always felt like someone broke in and was living down there __eou__ There weren't any sources of light down there!? __eou__ i was too scared to even open the door to turn it on  __eou__ So you have no idea what's down there!? __eou__ nope no clue! i want to start traveling so i wouldnt have to worry about a basement but dont have the money __eou__ Yes, get out of there as soon as possible! You don't want to be trapped with all that stuff down there!! __eou__ i wish i could start selling my houses made of matches its a strong hobby of mine it would help with the money problem __eou__ I've never heard of that! How is it making a house with matches? __eou__ its very fun and relaxing actually except when you get burned by the glue gun __eou__ Ah, that does not sound like fun. Should I get into it? __eou__ i think everyone should but if youre looking to sell theres not much demand ive found out the hard way __eou__ How exactly do you sell them?
I think so!! What's typically inside a taco? __eou__ well you can make a taco with a variety of fillings such as beef, pork chicken, seafood and vegetables with cheese  __eou__ What are you favorite fillings or toppings for tacos? __eou__  I love chicken and chorizo with sour cream, cilantro, and onion __eou__ That sounds good, minus the cilantro. I am not a fan of it. __eou__ that is too bad ! ! you are missing out ! __eou__ So I've been told. I can tolerate it in some salsas, but only freshly made ones. __eou__ Fresh made salsa is the only way to go! Do you like any other Hispanic food? __eou__ I enjoy most anything that comes in a tortilla, or can be eaten with a tortilla. Especially taquitos __eou__ Me too! I love tortas, quesadillas, and horchata! __eou__ Oh, quesadillas, I somehow forgot about those. A local restaurant makes the best ones. __eou__ Do you like food trucks? __eou__ I do, but we don't have any where I live. They are a must when I vacation in larger cities though. You? __eou__ i love anything off of a food truck ! what do you do for fun ?
I always feel nervous in a crowd. __eou__ That's not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently? __eou__ Yes I do I have to fix it somehow. __eou__ i am a teacher so I am always in a crowded classroom __eou__ Maybe I can sit in to get over my fear __eou__ I thin kyou can do it! Just try and mentally prepare __eou__ That's easier said than done __eou__ Maybe its just a matter of energy, I like coffee to get me ready for situations __eou__ I'm a daily coffee drinker.i need a stronger drunk! __eou__ I also drink coffee every day, what do you do for work __eou__ I'm  a librarian. __eou__ That sounds like a good way to avoid crowds at least __eou__ Yes and it quite. __eou__ could probably have some booze in your coffe there and no one would know
I have bad vision as well, I just wear glasses and contacts, I am sorry you are struggling with it __eou__ Yes it is crazy in this day and age that people do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. __eou__ Unfortunately, they can be expensive and it is one of those things that people try to do without if they can't afford it.n __eou__ Yes it is crazy how expensive it is just to be able to see when some people can just like..... wake up in the morning and see?  __eou__ Yes -- being a nurse - I see alot of patients who struggle - and not just with visual impairments. __eou__ This is very cool, my twin sister works in a hospital as well. Are you enjoying it? __eou__ Yes very much -- but its long hours and does take its toll. __eou__ Yeah, she says the same but she also get to help a lot of people. __eou__ Agreed - seeing them recover and return home healthy means I did something right. __eou__ yes , life is wonderful and we should help other people __eou__ Always -- even when I am not working - I volunteer at the local food bank.

They mean the world to me. __eou__ That is great. I have a daughter and one grandson.  __eou__ Oh, how nice!

i never done any working purposes just ride for fun __eou__ I know that a lot of horses are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as fox hunting, trail riding or hacking which seems like a lot of fun. __eou__ Hacking is another term for the type of recreational riding I do. Funny, I never thought of myself as a "hacker" before. __eou__ Ha.  Could you imagine if you were an actual hacker? __eou__ I suspect my kids would think I was much cooler! __eou__ The old "It'd be cooler if you [were]". __eou__ Right? "Nellie's mom's in a band" __eou__ I've been meaning to ask - do you have any recommendations for a nice restaurant to visit?  I'm more used to ... ordering in. __eou__ Hmm. What kind of food do you like? __eou__ I'd say my tastes are more on the exotic end of the spectrum. Maybe somewhere that I could meet someone? __eou__ Have you tried the Cellar? It's that new place on the Plaza. Underground and completely dark. Supposed to be a hot date restaurant __eou__ I may need to give that a try.  Completely dark could certainly make things exciting. __eou__ Supposedly you can really concentrate on the sensual aspects of the food __eou__ Sounds like that could be the place to have an old friend for dinner.

Not the dumb commercial trap rap, more introspective stuff __eou__ really music...like that! all that commercial crap is killing the culture __eou__ yea i understand __eou__ are you pursuing that as a career? __eou__ No, it is more of a fantasy for me, I already have a degree, wouldn't want to to back to get a veterinary degree
MY kid loves her new school and she doesnt like anything! __eou__ Don't be daft! Kids should never watch tv! __eou__ why not? __eou__ depending on their age - you have to monitor what they watch - some are just so inappropriate __eou__ Yes, you are right. I prefer Youtube, I get to restrict the inappropriate content  __eou__ yes - easier to control __eou__ also it is full of cats videos! __eou__ I don't watch cat videos - but like the practical jokes ones __eou__ What's your job? __eou__ I am retired - which is why I have time to watch different things.

I feel like recycling is also a great trait! __eou__ I agree too! And you can to some great art while recycling. Art has really helped me as I am struggling with my marriage. __eou__ Yes, art is the best. There's nothing quite like it! __eou__ That is true. It allows you to express yourself whether you are sad or happy.   __eou__ Exactly! Tattoos are the ultimate expression of self __eou__ Agreed.   I have one symbolic with a specific meaning pertinent to me. __eou__ Oh what is it of? __eou__ It is a heart with a large red rose in the center! My husband designed it for me so it is special to me.

They have stuck with me through some tough times so I tolerate it. __eou__ gotta take the good with the bad i suppose __eou__ Indeed.

As I got older I stopped going __eou__ Do you play Fantasy football? __eou__ No, I do not. I am a ballet dancer __eou__ Wow! what if there was a Fantasy ballet dancer? __eou__ I would guess that a ballet league of sorts would have to be in place for that to work.

I love his double disc albums  __eou__ who doesnt! one of the best rappers in my opinion  __eou__ Definitely. I love his double disc albums  __eou__ are you sleepy? you already said that! __eou__ No but lonely sometimes
I have not. __eou__ I work daily with the practical application of law and legal theories. It's a lot of fun.  __eou__ It depends on the cases! I work with not very fun cases __eou__ you have to be really logical to be able to apply the legal theories __eou__ yes, very cold and not emotionally involved __eou__ I love watching the legal shows - and try to figure out who is guilty __eou__ which one is your favourite?  __eou__ i like true detective __eou__ Nice, me too.  __eou__ yes - some of the true stories are stranger than fiction. __eou__ Do you have kids? __eou__ yes - they are in college -  __eou__ I have 2 kids, they are the love of my life __eou__ yes - kids keep you active
i love chocolate . malted milk powder is my secret ! i add it to cookies too . __eou__ dang that's good ! mind if i steal your secret ? lol __eou__ Not at all, you dont have to steal it, it's yours! __eou__ I adore malted milk.  I hate that Brach's Malted milk balls are gone.   __eou__ Me too, I always got them in my Easter basket as a kid. __eou__ Nothing quite like them on the market.  So what music are you into? __eou__ I love all music, I flip flog a lot currently I am listening to country top hits. You? __eou__ Huge country fan.  Lliving in Alabama (yes I do), that's about all you can hear.  Unfortunately, I like the old school, twangy stuff.  It's coming back though. __eou__ I like in MO, on a cattle farm, so goes hand in hand, lol! Some of the new stuff doesn't sound like country at all! __eou__ yes , i'm sure many would agree with that . the new country is more like pop . __eou__ Any halloween plans? __eou__ Working.  But we have a mean Halloween party at work - lots of food and everyone dresses up __eou__ I am working too, no Halloween fun here though.... got to take my little girl trick or treating tonight though, its her first. __eou__ Cool!  What is she going as?
that sounds interesting , what are your hobbies __eou__ you aren't reading what i type __eou__ I am reading everything you type lol __eou__ Well how do you feel about history then? __eou__ I enjoy it very much. I find it fascinating that everything that we are able to read about happened and in certain forms begins to repeat itself __eou__ See, that's better! History is my favorite as well, my father didn't care much for it though __eou__ I think it is harder for some because they see it as a boring subject. But it is supposed to be understood with one's perception as well as their intellect. __eou__ That makes sense, my father worked much with his hands and not with his head, so he usually avoided things like this __eou__ lol. what did your father do? __eou__ He worked doing dry wall. Still required thinking, but of a different type __eou__ Ah. I enjoy watching home improvement shows. I enjoy the creativity of it all. I'll bet he enjoyed doing it in real life. __eou__ For sure! He loved doing this type of stuff and still does! __eou__ Yes.It is so satisfying to watch! I enjoy that as well as any other display of creativity. __eou__ Yes! Did you do anything similar?
Its really good, timeless classic __eou__ It's crazy to think that the first of it's kind appeared in the 1800's! So much history. __eou__ Right?!  It's a rich history __eou__ sure is! and there is a lot of history too begining in 1607.... __eou__ I had no idea it went back that far.  Where did you find that information? __eou__ I done searches online, went to the library, and even visited some universities to see what information they found __eou__ Wow, you're quite the historian. I do love doing that kind of research, though __eou__ I enjoy learning about new and different things so that is a plus. Research is great, it's like putting together a puzzle. __eou__ I actually work in research for a living.  I think my dad gave me that love. __eou__ Your dad is a smart man, that is awesome! __eou__ It's a fascinating job.  I review research done in humans (you know, clinical trials) for ethics __eou__ That is amazing...I love that field. so many exciting new things every day. __eou__ True, every day is completely different __eou__ You come in contact with so many different type of people...i think that sounds like a cool job
so friend i just went on a vacation and i was very happy i needed it __eou__ Yes! where did you go? do you feel relaxed? __eou__ We went to Rome. It was pretty cool. We stayed in a convent just a block from the Spanish Steps. __eou__ Last time I went on vacation I got a little too crazy and ended up coming back with two tattoos! __eou__ Hey, permanent souvenirs! Nice! What did you get? __eou__ I got red flames across both arms. The color contrasts well with my curly red hair. __eou__ You're lucky. I love red hair. I'm blonde and used to dye my hair red, but it never looked natural. My skin coloring or something was off. __eou__ Actually I think contrast wasn't the right word. It's better to say that it complements my red hair! __eou__ I think contrasting and complementary colors might be the same? Like purple/yellow and red/green are complementary colors, but they are pretty contrast-y. __eou__ That might be true. Unfortunately I don't think I know much about the subject. __eou__ Oh, I don't either. Doesn't stop me from speculating, though! What's your jam? What do you know a lot about? __eou__ Music. I could tell you everything there is to know about any genre. __eou__ What kinds do you like to listen to most? __eou__ I'd say pop and classic rock. Those two are my favorites.
I dont know a lot about EDM. Is there anything interesting you could tell me? __eou__ Sure! It became popular in the late 80s/early 90s in Europe as club culture also became more popular. __eou__ Is it still growing today? __eou__ yes , especially in the club scene in atlanta and music festivals . i like to party __eou__ Do you go to clubs alot? __eou__ i make a good amount , yes . nightclubs and concerts . how about you ? __eou__ On the weekend i go out with friends. __eou__ What type of clubs do you go to? __eou__ dance clubs. We 2 step a lot. i love going to eat eggs and bacon for breakfast after the club. __eou__ That's the perfect combination of activities __eou__ Do you dance? __eou__ Yes it's  great cardio __eou__ Yes keeps me in shape __eou__ im sure youre in tip top shape.

I know I can be selfish at times, and weak. __eou__ how were you being "Selfish" __eou__ I put my needs ahead of my boyfriend's and now my heart is broken :( __eou__ well things take time i wouldnt say change youll find someone that loves you for you __eou__ I appreciate the kind words, thank you. I still feel motivated to change and I hope I can over time __eou__ well i wish you luck! im not sure how you feel about games but its a hobby of mine and helps get your mind off thing! __eou__ I love games, too!

I like playing with friends, too. Really helps take my mind off things __eou__ whats your favorite game? __eou__ It's so hard to pick lol - maybe Overwatch __eou__ i was just playing thats the junkerstein mode is super fun 
Does it have pagan roots? __eou__ I'm not sure if it has pagan roots, but it has definite Christian roots. It's celebrated on the 25th of December throughout the world __eou__ Sounds cool!  So how has your diet been going? The doctor told me I need to get more iron.. ugh! __eou__ Spinach, man.  I hate the mushy cooked stuff, but I could eat it all day in salads.  Try it raw. __eou__ Really? I do like it raw, but I agree with you on eating it cooked! Yuck!! __eou__ My husband loves liver, but it grosses me out, but I hear it has a lot of iron too __eou__ Yeah I don't think I could handle eating that even for the extra iron! I love eating kale wonder if that has iron do you know? __eou__ I don't.  I just know that it's better to get the iron from food than from a supplement __eou__ That is I thought too. I think I will make an appointment with a nutritionist, can't hurt what do you think?  __eou__ Yeah, that's a good idea.  I met with one when I got diagnosed as diabetic, and it was really helpful __eou__ Being diabetic must make it hard. How do you handle the holidays? I am such a sweets person! __eou__ Oh, I love Christmas, so I just plan ahead.  A little of this, a little of that __eou__ Yeah, that will be me this year. Got to try and cut back, mind over matter!  __eou__ and a little cheating....!

Do you like Sushi? __eou__ I like the fake sushi that does not have any uncooked fish __eou__ lol. that is how i started eating it.  __eou__ I actually have a fish allergy so I have to be careful __eou__ OMG! i am so sorry. your missing out. __eou__ Thanks, but its okay. I always say that "you cant miss what you never had". __eou__ Very true Do you volunteer. Helping people makes me Happy?  __eou__ No, I spend most of my free time building my ford truck __eou__ WOW! is it a old one what year? __eou__ Early 80's, he's quite the beast __eou__ is it a 4X4? __eou__ Yep, sure is. I take it off road and it will go through anything.
Yes, I have. Many times. It is wonderful and doesn't seem to go out of date like a lot of movies. __eou__ It was based on the novel of the same name written by Margaret Mitchell __eou__ I love gone with the wind? do you like that movie? __eou__ I have never seen the movie. I'm sure I'm missing out. __eou__ you have to go see it. OMG!! __eou__ Being from TN I know I shouldve saw it by now. I'm just busy with my dog a lot. __eou__ Is he your fur baby? __eou__ Yes!

I went to a baseball game with my favorite team a few weeks ago. They had been doing pretty badly in the first half. Somehow they managed to pull it together and win in the end! That made me very happy! __eou__ That's awesome! Sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright! Shows perseverance and a "never give up" attitude. __eou__ I agree, perseverance si a key human motivator. It can turn the outcome and can potentially make the underdo the winner.  __eou__ I know a lot of people root for the underdog, but I prefer games where there is no clear favorite. Fair, even, matches are more interesting to watch. __eou__ I tend to agree,a fair even match is just the right kinda match, like a perfect suspense movie. __eou__ I hope the Superbowl this year is an even match, some of the past years have been disappointing. __eou__ Oh yeah, nothing against the patriots but the superbowl has gotten a bit boring seeing them numerous times. I need some fresh teams. __eou__ Remember a few years back when the Colts played the Bears? Disappointing game but awesome half-time show - my favorite artist played. __eou__  i feel like superbowl is trying to attract more people to the game, by having an attractive half time show , along with non football related things. __eou__ I think Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are playing the show this year. __eou__ that is cool, i will be checking it out for sure, now we need a good game.  __eou__ Any predictions on who might be playing? __eou__ have not been following the scene off late, but would like seahawks, their QB is from my school __eou__ A repeat of 2014 would be nice, it was cool to see a different team get some attention.
I haven't tried rotisserie chicken. Can you buy them ready to eat? __eou__ you sure can! rotation cooks the meat evenly in it's own juices that's why chickens are so soft and juicy __eou__ I would love to have one in my garden this summer __eou__ How would you get a rotisserie chicken in your garden? __eou__ I mean, I would love to organize an outdoor lunch with my family __eou__ Ah, that makes more sense. Chicken would be great for a lunch with everyone!  What else would you have? __eou__ I would love to BBQ some Beef __eou__ BBQ beef and rotisserie chicken would be a good combination, it would give people options.  What side dishes would you have? __eou__ Salad and corn. I love cooking, I could do it for hours __eou__ I like cooking too!  It relaxes me as much as art does.   __eou__ Yes! The same here, it is my favourite hobby __eou__ I'm almost done with art school, I'll be happy when its over.  What type of art do you do? __eou__ I am into Graphic Arts __eou__ I like graphic art, I really like working with acrylics though.
My elderly neighbor just recently had to put her dog to sleep. That dog was her best friend and companion. __eou__ That's sad. is she going to get another one? __eou__ No, and it really isn't fair that bad stuff happens like this __eou__ It is sad.

Isn't that crazy?  It really looks like it rises in the East and sets in the West! __eou__ yes that illusion of a moving sun from earth observers being roated - it's so convincing that mythologies and religions built this around the geocentric model and wasn't until 16th century the truth was formulated! __eou__ The Catholic Church did not help  __eou__ That's weird conclusion. But, Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book. __eou__ If you think about it, the Pope and his circle were opposing this new idea at the time __eou__  Yes; exactly. Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments __eou__ Imagine how difficult it was to fight such an affirmed establishment __eou__ Oh yes you get it even tough they encountered various struggles following the creation of the Church of England __eou__ I love the fact that science is freedom.

Did anything big happen in year 34? __eou__ not really, just did a lot of fishing, caught a mean 6 pound bass! __eou__ No way!  That sound pretty fun!  Where did you catch him? __eou__ over in texas, medina lake! __eou__ Awesome!  Have you ever been deep sea fishing? __eou__ No but i really want to, a three day trip!, they are kind of pricey though, have you? __eou__ I did last year with my brother in law and friends.  Its not as bad if you can split up the cost! __eou__ thats true, but i only have one friend that likes to fish, and we dont really talk that much because of work:/ __eou__ Work can make it difficult.  You can always see if there is anyone else in the area looking to go with a group though!

Do you like it? __eou__ yes i love it. it is good for my blood type. i learned about it while studying the blood type diet.  __eou__ Is there  a diet which is just Vegetraian+chicken? __eou__ i think that would just be called a restricted diet. i know some dont really like fish. so if you prefer chicken i dont think theres anything against it lol __eou__ That sounds good. I learnt something today. __eou__ yes. we learn something new everyday lol. i recommend researching your bloodtype and eating for that. you'll feel so much better
Oh I love to watch people salsa but have no idea how to do it myself __eou__ You know, it's actually not as old as people may think. It, along with Salsa music, comes from 1970s New York, with origins from the Puerto Rican bomba and plena, Cuban Son, cha-cha-cha, mambo, and others. So, it's kind of an amalgamation. __eou__ That's really interesting, does this mean you're an expert? __eou__ I'm not an expert in Salsa.  I like to watch it but I have no rhythm at all.  Do you like to dance? __eou__ I'm not very good, but I do find it's a good way to meet new people! __eou__ What type of dancing do you do?  Have you ever tried Salsa? __eou__ I tried it once, but my hips just aren't up to it! I prefer Swing dancing - how about yourself? __eou__ Swing looks fun too!  I like watching lol, but if I had to pick anything it would probably be swing as well. __eou__ Yeah it is really fun, although I'm really a bit too tall for that style of dancing - lots of crouching required! __eou__ You just need to find a taller dance partner, that might help a little anyway. __eou__ Very true, although honestly I'd prefer a night in with pizza and beer... __eou__ Yeah, I agree.  I would drink some beer, eat some pizza, and make some comics...that would be a perfect night to me. __eou__ Sounds great, well it's been nice to chat to you -  maybe we'll meet at a swing club sometime in the future?! __eou__ Yeah, that could be a lot of fun!
i have always liked nerdy people . how are you today ? __eou__ doing quite well ! i have baked a pie in the shape of pi , ha . how about yourself ? __eou__ I love pies! what flavor did you bake? __eou__ Pumpkin, trying to get into the spirit of the season. __eou__ Pumpkin is a good one, what is your favorite? __eou__ I like apple, but no one else in the family does so I rarely make it. __eou__ My grandma used to make the best apple pies! My favorite is pecan __eou__ I like pecan, but I usually only have it around Thanksgiving. __eou__ Same here, and Christmas time as well. __eou__ The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is my favorite part of the year.  __eou__ I love spring time the best, when everything is coming back to life. __eou__ Spring is nice, but every seems so busy then. In the winter, my family slows down and spends more time together. __eou__ My family likes to hunt so we do spend alot of time at the deer lease in the winter months. Its peaceful and quiet __eou__ Fun, exciting times are nice once in a while, but I would choose peaceful and quiet for the long-term.
I don't have a job currently. So today, I robbed an old lady. I feel bad about it. __eou__ Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it. __eou__ I know but I was desperate. __eou__ I mean, I get desperate times, but is there not a church or something in your area you could have turned to for help? __eou__ Well, I did. they told me that they won't pay me to travel to Nashville. __eou__ Why do you need to travel to Nashville? __eou__ One of my dreams is to become a country music star. __eou__ That's cool. How much did you steal from the old lady? Enough to buy a bus ticket? __eou__ Not really. After spending part of the money in a bar to watch some football on t.v., I barely had anything left. __eou__ Sounds like money poorly spent. __eou__ Oh no! Not at all! The Packers were playing. __eou__ Oh no, a Packers fan? Go Patriots! __eou__ I respect the Patriots, I lived in Boston for a while. __eou__ What was it like? I've never been __eou__ Awesome! Many rich old ladies around, if you know what I mean. __eou__ Oh goodness. 
Chameleons are cool, too. Have you ever owned any lizards? __eou__ Well, I don't but my kid has a chameleon, it's so cute.

You know I love cooking for people and one of the things he love was beef carpaccio.  __eou__ That is nice. I love to practice with my dog. He loves to chase the soccer ball with me. __eou__ We do you guys practice? Is there any park near by you? __eou__ No but the soccer field is not too far away, we go there. __eou__ nice! Can your dog do any trick? Like swimming in a pool? swimming is a great exercise for dogs __eou__ Yes he swims, in the lake mostly. __eou__ Beautiful. How ofter do you guys go to the lake and which lake do you go?
I get feel so irate when I lose any form of game. __eou__ Me too! I like to win, I guess that makes me competitive. __eou__ have you been always co competitive? __eou__ Yes, I love a good challenge! It's fun. __eou__ I don't know, sometimes I feel it brings out the worst in people. __eou__ For some yes. Healthy competition is a good thing I think __eou__ As long as no finance is involved, I deem it not to be harmful at all __eou__ I agree. I don't put finances in it at all. __eou__ Some of my husbands friends lost tons of money on online sports bets, however some made good money __eou__ I don't have enough extra money to gamble like that. Plus I'm not lucky. __eou__ They always told some jibber jabber about diversifying the risk in order to unsure profit. But what do I know right? __eou__ That goes over my head. I don't know enough to speak on it. __eou__ Guess we have something in common. Are you a fan of any sports team by any chance? __eou__ I like the Orioles and Nationals. Local teams, but not the Ravens.

I hope it is not too costly to fix. __eou__ Maybe i can fix it with patches. __eou__ Patches would work. It could even add some unique character to the quilt. __eou__ That is what i was thinking, what kind of material should i use? __eou__ I would try to material that is similar to the quilt. I know fabric stores have many fabric samples. __eou__ Good idea, it will look. __eou__ Sounds good. I hope it works out!
Yes! They taste nice in desserts like apple crumble as they are quite tart. What's your favourite type of apple? __eou__ I like Grammy Smith because it so easy to make in cooking anything that needs apples.  __eou__ I have a Granny Smith apple tree, but it has yet to produce any apples. Maybe next year I'll have better luck with it. __eou__ I had the same problem, although my tree was attacked by greenfly so didn't give any fruit! __eou__ I am not familiar with greenfly - is that a type of insect? __eou__ yeah that's right, they swarm over the tree and 'suffocate' it meaning it doesn't produce any apples. __eou__ I see. Are they easy to get rid of, or is it a yearly battle? __eou__ Apparently if you cover the tree with fairy liquid it's supposed to help but it definitely didn't work for us! Do you have any other fruit trees? __eou__ That's too bad. Yes, I have a couple of pear trees and cherry trees. Those at least produce some fruit for us. __eou__ Oh that's great. I love fruit so we have 10 different trees in our garden! __eou__ 10 different trees!? What kinds? __eou__ Cherry, pears, apples, and oranges! __eou__ An orange tree sounds fun.

Find a different dress or a new best friend! __eou__ True. I guess the dress would be easier  __eou__ Yeah, I think so too. Best friends are hard to come by these days. __eou__ Agreed! Do you have a best friend? __eou__ Maybe one. I'm not really a people person. __eou__ Im the same way, thats why the dress would be easier in my case.  __eou__ How did you meet your best friend? __eou__ We went to middle school together __eou__ So you have been friends a long time.

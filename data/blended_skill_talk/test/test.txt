Wow, I am never shy. Do you have anxiety? __eou__ Yes. I end up sweating and blushing and feel like i'm going to throw up. __eou__ and why is that? __eou__ I think it's because in my head, I think everyone is judging me. I just start to sweat and I get sick in my stomach. __eou__ interesting but I know how you feel especially the whole people telling that it in your head  __eou__ I don't really have people telling me in my head, more like behind my back __eou__ Dang that's though. But I also understand that. I have people some who talks behind my back because of certain things that I believe in  __eou__ Me too! What do you believe in? I believe in dragons... Just finished watching Game of Thrones. Man, those things are dope
My turtle ran away from me today. __eou__ Oh my god. Did you guys have a fight? __eou__ that's funny. No. I let him roam around the house. __eou__ What does your turtle eat?  Is it hard to take care of a turtle? __eou__ He eats insects, leaves and sun flower seeds. It's easy. They don't need walking and cleanup is simple. Do you have any pets? __eou__ No, not at the moment.  I have 3 girls and they are enough trouble! LOL __eou__ Congratulations. Do you come from a big family? __eou__ I don't, just 2 siblings.  But my wife wanted a lot of kids. So, there you go. __eou__ Wow. cool. How often do you use computers? __eou__ I use a Mac for my work - I'm a music teacher.  I find it really helpful.  How about you?  Are you on the computer a lot? __eou__ Often. I use them at work for editing. I head about a way to stream videos or movies from the local library. __eou__ Stream from the library - now, that sounds interesting. My wife and I do some scuba diving and want to begin filming underwater. Ever tried that? __eou__ No, but I have snorkled. __eou__ That's cool too. That's how we began.  Seen lots of Turtles!  LOL
Our son in the Army is taking a leave to visit us next month. __eou__ Oh, you must be so excited! I have a son in the Army as well and I love when he gets to visit!  __eou__ Can't believe he grew up so quick __eou__ Yeah, kids grow up so quickly  __eou__ What do you usually do when he visits? __eou__ We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really. __eou__ I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :) __eou__ You're only as old as you feel is what I say. __eou__ Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^ __eou__ Not really since I am usually spending my time alone in my studio painting, but I might give it some thought. __eou__ You should. I am not really a blond, but I would say cute and the kids dig me. :) And you know, sometimes I let them play with me __eou__ Well everyone is an adult so who am I to judge, sounds like a good bit of fun to me. __eou__ What are you up to now, girl? __eou__ Just about to clean up my paints and and put them away for the day. __eou__ Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day
that's awesome , i like running in the morning instead of night __eou__ sounds nice . i only eat meat even though i enjoy canning __eou__ Canning is great for storing food. Sometimes I can food before my marathons to calm my anxiety. __eou__ Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long __eou__ Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person? __eou__ I'm totally a morning person.  I wake naturally around 6 a.m. And you? __eou__ I wake up at 6 a.m.when I have work, sometimes I'll get up at 5 a.m. though for a morning run. __eou__ So, how long and how far is your morning run?  And when you prepare for a marathon? __eou__ Generally I'll run about 3 miles, but when a marathon is coming up I'll build my way up to 5 or 7 miles every morning. __eou__ That's impressive.  I would like to try but I just don't have the stamina! Do you ever run with a dog? __eou__ I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets? __eou__ No pets, just a crowd of feral cats from the neighborhood that roam through the yard. Fun to watch. __eou__ Oh that sounds funny, I like seeing cats roaming about the neighborhood. Cats are quiet creatures that really know how to take it easy! __eou__ We've had to step in a few times when one was injured, or a mama cat died. But they are timid creatures. __eou__ They really are timid. It's very special when a feral cat trusts you enough to approach you.
Are there different skill levels?  __eou__ I do not know of specific levels, but rock climbing is physically and mentally challenging, it requires endurance agility and balance so you must start small  __eou__ How would I start rock climbing? __eou__ I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment __eou__ I will do that. I will take my mom with me since she is my best friend. __eou__ It's good to have a spotter! Also, get in overall good shape with an emphasis on balance __eou__ Where should be go after the fitnes place? Would the ocean be a good spot? __eou__ Ha ha - not for rock climbing.  Maybe you are thinking of diving? __eou__ I was thinking about diving. I would love to see some real life mermaids. __eou__ You may need to limit yourself to Disneyland for mermaids.  They're not actually real. __eou__ Thats not true. My mother told me they really exist. __eou__ I see.  I wonder where she has seen them? __eou__ She saw them when she was younger. I will believe my best friend since I know my mother well. __eou__ Far be it to argue with anyone's mother!  Do you have siblings?
This is the first time I drop my kids off to school and I know it'll be hard but I know the school si really good and the teachers are so wonderful. __eou__ It is the start of their learning journey, be excited! __eou__ I am excited.

In second grade, that's where the kiddos will begin learning mathematics and science and social studies among other subjects __eou__  I really don't know anyone around, but most of this neighborhood is young. What do you do for work? __eou__ I work for a Mexican cartel that kidnaps 1st graders and sells them into slavery... ;) Just kidding __eou__ haaa. well no one works if they don't have to. I took a year off traveling last year. __eou__ I'm only kidding lol. I am a veterinarian. I love dogs and cats! Well and children too :) __eou__ cool. the only dogs and cats I see are dead, embalmed and on display. Guess where I work? __eou__ The morgue! ROFL __eou__ haaa, a museum. __eou__ That was my second guess :) but it was too late, I pressed the Send button __eou__ It's amazing. but it's the only people I know here. recommend any restaurants? __eou__ McDonald's? :) Just kidding... Well I don't even know where you live, but I'd say SoHo Sushi is my fave
I kept all of my kids first day pics every year. They are in a book __eou__ I need to try and do that. __eou__ It's really great to have the memories. __eou__ What do your kids look back at the pictures you kept of theme over the years __eou__ Usually pictures of their families and their pets that they love so much. __eou__ Pets are part of the family like humans, what typ of pets do you have if any __eou__ I have one cat but I want to get another! Do you have any pets? __eou__ I have 2 dogs, oreo and cupcake, they are goldendoodles __eou__ Wow, I've never heard of goldendoodles before. That's a bit hard to pronounce with my accent! __eou__ They are a cross of a poodle and golden retreiver, they make great family dogs, kids love them __eou__ That sounds so cute. My kitty could really use a friend, maybe I'll get a goldendoodle! __eou__ Cats can be picky if you do get one get a puppy so they get along __eou__ That's a smart idea, I want my kitty to feel at home. Do you like cats? __eou__ I do, I have a family member who has an adorable ragdoll cat name Max

I like the change in seasons but not very fond of the cold weather that comes in winter __eou__ I like it. I wish the weather was a nicer. Winter lasts too long? __eou__ Winter does feel like it can drag on, I just try to remember the next season is spring, I like spring the weather is great late spring __eou__ Have you ever visited any other cities? I may go on a trip this winter. __eou__ I have been to many cities around the world, try to avoid cities that have rainy seasons or get too cold in winter __eou__ right. the rain can ruin a whole day if trying to explore a city. __eou__ Yes some cities, get flooded like Venice in winter or get too cold like northern ctiies in Europe, America and Canada __eou__ i know what you mean . flooding is not something i like to deal with . __eou__ It's a good way to get a cheap flight or hotel but it's not for me either __eou__ yes, I use a few apps to check flights, but Priceline or Expedia still have the best deals.
Ah, even though I went to the factory I'm still unsure about the history. How long have they been around? __eou__ The company was founded all the way back in 1894. __eou__ Ok that's interesting, how do you know about that? __eou__ Hershey's is the pinnacle of chocolate and have been relevant for years and years. __eou__ I don't eat much chocolate, I try to keep in shape for Cross Country __eou__ Everything is good in moderation. I personally believe eating too much of something is the issue here. __eou__ I agree, how much Hersheys do you eat? __eou__ Being from Georgia, I developed quite the sweet tooth in my younger days. However now I tend to have a Hershey's once in a while. __eou__ Sounds like you had a great childhood then! __eou__ You could say that. What was your childhood like? __eou__ I can't really remember a lot, but I did play a lot of basketball with my friends __eou__ I love basketball!

I've forgotten my wallet before. __eou__ Yes it was!, but it was a lesson learned  to not forget again. __eou__ Definitely. Where did you go to lunch? __eou__ Went to a nice sushi spot around down town. __eou__ I love sushi! We should go sometime! __eou__ That would be a good idea to meet up and enjoy some lovely sushi. __eou__ I am free on Saturday for dinner.

How was your relationship with your parents? __eou__ it was good, this happened in my adult life so we all had work and stuff and maybe did not socialize as often as we could have __eou__ I understand.  I guess I tend to socialize with my cat the most.  He is almost like family. __eou__ i think pets can be family for sure. just hanging out with them and petting them can be really calming __eou__ Most definitely, except when he knocks stuff off of tables.  Do you have any pets? __eou__ i used to have a cat that was really bad about that, couldn't have anything on tables at all. but now i have a dog and a couple cats __eou__ How does your dog get along with the cats? __eou__ they mostly just ignore each other. the cats are actually bigger than him so they never really seem worried about his presence __eou__ What kind of dog is it? __eou__ a mix but mostly chihuahua, so he is tiny __eou__ I heard Chihuhuas are evil.  Any truth to that? __eou__ nooo, he is super sweet and lazy because he's an old man
Whoa! so that was crazy.  You'll never guess what just happened. __eou__ Did you win that lottery?? __eou__ Haha I wish! My ex texted me the other day. She apparently still loves me. __eou__ Huh, but why did you break up in the first place? __eou__ We wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and I didn't. Stuff like that. __eou__ Do you think either of you have changed your minds on that stuff? __eou__ I have. I think I want kids now. __eou__ Maybe you guys could try hanging out again before jumping back into dating. Did you stay friends after breaking up? __eou__ Somewhat. We have both dated a couple other people, but we see each other at parties and stuff. Hanging out before dating is a good idea. __eou__ I think it'd be fine if you guys tried angling towards dating again then, if you are also into it. Just don't feel pressured by her feelings! __eou__ Maybe I'll ask her to go on a walk with me at a park this weekend.  __eou__ That could be nice, it'd be a good chance to talk and get caught up. __eou__ Definitely. And see if we are on the same page, possibly, for the future. No need to rush into things. __eou__ Definitely. Going from being exes to dating and definitely having kids would be way too fast. __eou__ Indeed. Well, talk to you later! __eou__ Yep, see ya!
In Quake's single-player mode, players explore and navigate to the exit of each Gothic and dark level, its a very scary game with a lot of monsters, its like a sci-fi game __eou__ Now, that does sound cool!

Is that similar to sudoku? __eou__ This one is the ultimate version of it, it is worth checking out __eou__ I'll definitely check it out! Where do you play? __eou__ I just at home when I have the chance. __eou__ Nice! Do you have a book of sudoka, or do you play on a computer? __eou__ I do have several books that I like to play through. __eou__ Nice! I am heading to the mall in Chicago tomorrow. I will have to pick up a book! __eou__ That sounds nice, I have never been to Chicago, but pics of the place seems so nice. __eou__ It is a little too crowded for my tastes, but it is a decent place to live.  __eou__ I'm sure it is. Maybe I'll visit too

I have tried an electric keyboard and a regular piano before. __eou__ Did you like playing them? __eou__ The keyboard was fun with all the different sound fonts.

I guess I am old school like that.  __eou__ Why do you like getting news from a newspaper more? __eou__ I find it easier to read words printed in ink. Plus I can clean windows with the newspaper when I am done reading it! __eou__ Yeah sometimes my eyes start to hurt after looking at a screen too long. __eou__ Yeah. Do you ever use the blue light filter feature on your devices?  __eou__ No what is that? __eou__ It filters out blue light from your electronic devices. This keeps your eyes from straining while viewing your device.  __eou__ I will definitely look into that because I work a lot on my computer. __eou__ I know Galaxy phones have the feature built in and it works great!

I try to practise whenever I got time free from college __eou__ far more than the piano,i love the harpsichord.i hate that it fell out of style __eou__ I have never heard of a harpsichord. Is it similar to a piano? __eou__ it was the predecessor to the piano.it looks quite similar but sounds much different.next time you're on youtube,type it in and give it a listen __eou__ I definitely will.

I enjoy the fresh crisp morning air! __eou__ I tend to have trouble sleeping so I never have been one. __eou__ That is tough.

Even on days that are hot! __eou__ I have never felt the supposed energy boost that it gives people, have you? __eou__ No. I use caffeine so much it just makes me feel normal.  __eou__ Did you used to feel it? __eou__ Maybe when I was younger.

ok ,where is the earliest history of mac and cheese? __eou__ I'm not sure of the exact origins, but I read somewhere that the dish was recorded in a medieval English cookbook in the 14th century! __eou__ Was it as popular as it is now? __eou__ Actually not! It used to be called "makerouns" though I"m not sure why. __eou__ That's funny...maybe it was the type of cheese that they used. __eou__ I read that it was made with fresh hand-cut pasta and then slathered with butter and cheese. So it sounds exactly like what we make today! __eou__ Do you know what kind of cheese they used? Like usually we use cheddar now. __eou__ I don't, but whatever it was I bet it was delicious. Imagine how it was just from the same cow __eou__ Back then they could of made it with goat milk, but whatever animal they milked it was definitely fresh?

Sometimes I think i should get out and exercise more. __eou__ well i do make time to go outdoors with my kids. so that's where i get in some physical activity __eou__ I used to love the outdoors before I became a CEO and now the most outdoors I get is walking from my corvette to the office building. __eou__ its really hard to keep up a schedule. but hey i tend to feel better when i eat better. do you watch your diet? __eou__ I try to eat at higher quality restaurants but being on the road for business doesn't always allow that.

Rap music? I love the flows and the swaggs.What's your favorite rap star? __eou__ Eminem is one of my favorites honestly. He has great "content", "flow", as well as "delivery" which are all very important. __eou__ That's all important. He's okay. Who else do you like? __eou__ Jay-Z __eou__ Tbh I think his wife is a better rapper than he is ;) __eou__ lol __eou__ You don't think so? __eou__ I don't consider her a rapper, she's an okay rapper for a singer. __eou__ Why isn't she a rapper? __eou__ Because she is a singer.

About a year ago I lost my grandmother to cancer. I was really close to her. __eou__ I'm so sorry. I recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year. I know how you feel. __eou__ I'm really sorry to hear that. Losing two family members in such a short timespan is really heartbreaking.  __eou__ its really heart breaking. i'm so glad to have made good memories. it would be tragic if i had regrets __eou__ I completely agree. It makes you realize how important it is to spend time with people while they are here. __eou__ Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories. __eou__ That is a really good way of looking at it. And you can share those memories with new people in your life and breathe life into them. __eou__ You are so right. It can make all the difference. __eou__ Do you have other family members to help you after your loss? __eou__ yeah we have a large close knit family. how bout you? __eou__ We keep in touch, but all my immediate family lives rather far. So it is just me and my dogs at home. __eou__ so how do you feel about cancer... __eou__ It is really hard to watch people go through it, whether they decide to get treatment or just accept it. __eou__ same here . i just know a lot of people that actually is going through it .
All of the classes I wanted to take are full __eou__ Dang, that sucks. Did you find another class that is open? __eou__ Not that I wanted to take... maybe I'll just take the semester off... __eou__ No, that may throw you off by a whole semester!  I would be really mad if I were you! __eou__ I have a secret. Being born in Baton Rouge, I've always wanted to be a street performer in New Orleans! __eou__ That sounds like so much fun. How long have you been performing? __eou__ I never have but I've had an idea to be a pirate performer. That would be appropriate in New Orleans since it's off the coast.  __eou__ I love New Orleans. I bet you'd fit right in! __eou__ I practice my act with my parrot named Parrot. I'm Polly Pirate so she asks me if "Polly want a cracker?" It's a comedy act. __eou__ Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day! __eou__ I guess all my classes that I wanted to take being full is a true sign! Maybe I'll even take this to America's Got Talent one day!  __eou__ You're right, perhaps it's divine intervention! __eou__ Is there any other sort of intervention in life that puts you on the right track in life?! __eou__ Not without a lot of help!
I was hoping to go out with my friend's this weekend, but it was raining all weekend. __eou__ It's been raining a lot here, too, I know that feeling!

I had to give a speech one time in school and I was very nervous for it. __eou__ That can be nerve wrecking. How did you do? __eou__ anything i do i try to do great at it. i'd say i gave it my best. i was satisfied  __eou__ I understand, but at least you were prepared and you feel accomplished. __eou__ you dont get nervous to speak infront of crowds? __eou__ Extremely nervous, actually. But I haven't had that big of an issue since my speech course in college. Lucky for me I passed. __eou__ there is a course for anything isnt there __eou__ Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory __eou__ i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches __eou__ I get that. Even though it was mandatory, I'm glad I took it since I obviously needed it due to me running for political office back in 2004 __eou__ well you see. i know i would never go for a career where i would have to be that out there. its good that its mandatory though __eou__ Yeah that's why I went to school for computer hardware in case the political thing flopped. I build my own computers and run my own store now __eou__ so you had no success in politics? __eou__ Oh but I did, I'm actually the Vice President of this made up country __eou__ lmao  __eou__ It's called Ligma, I make like 800k a week
I've been working hard as a waiter this summer. Kind of fun since it's helped me develop social skills.. One person even tipped me $25 when their order was only like $8. Caught me off-guard that someone wanted to be that nice to me __eou__ I had some one tip me a $25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket. I cried lol __eou__ It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way. __eou__ He thought I was cute and old fashioned since I wore a locket. I still love to line dry my clothes! Nothing better, I say! __eou__ I agree with you! The way linens smell after being air dried is way better than any dryer sheet __eou__ A word of advice, always hang your clothes higher than your goats can reach! I learned that early on living on a homestead! Explains the missing socks! __eou__ Oh wow yeah! I never thought about that. I don't raise animals but my neighbor does. I do like to hunt deer from time to time. __eou__ We've had so many animals but their all for slaughter or use on the farm, chickens for eggs, goats for milk, ya know.... we hunt a lot as well. __eou__ That's great. I love animals, but I also love the thrill of the hunt. I use a bow to make it more interesting. __eou__ Wow! A bow! You're a true hunter! Ya know, all these animals I've owned but I've never had a true indoor pet? __eou__ Really? Man, pets are great too. I am lost without my dog. __eou__ I'll one day own a ferret. I've been selling our extra eggs at the market to save up for one! __eou__ Keep at it! Ferrets are cute little things.

We have binged quite a few shows. Do you have a favorite show? __eou__ Bojack horeseman yours? __eou__ I haven't tried that one, but I heard it is great. I think I it is a toss up between, "Making a Murderer" and  "The Crown". __eou__ What are the generes of those shows? __eou__ "Making a Murderer" is a documentary.

She has a passion for heights - she could dance along a cliff edge, it wouldn't bother her a bit. __eou__ Wow that sounds awful to me! I would much rather be in a casino lol __eou__ Yeah I don't have the best luck in casinos either. __eou__ I still like to gamble though __eou__ One time I went on a casino cruise and met a mermaid.

That and the beatles haha! __eou__ oh yes the beatles are the best of the best. but are they better than barbeque sandwiches?  __eou__ Oh yeah __eou__ too bad the beatles are not around anymore. Sometimes I like to imagine John Lennon is right here with me. __eou__ He is in spirit __eou__ Yes, he was the best musician ever. __eou__ They all were great __eou__ Absolutely. How about Paul McCartney's Christmas time classic?
Well my favorite steak is filet mignon because it is so tender. I usually get the queen cut because it is smaller but YUM! __eou__ Mmmm, delicious. It's a French cut, I think? From the tenderloin part? __eou__ I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste __eou__ Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years.  __eou__ Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do? __eou__ I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away. __eou__ Mmm what a way to relax! __eou__ It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all. __eou__ Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me __eou__ Honestly, opera can be so cool. __eou__ I'm glad you think so, most people just don't appreciate it at all __eou__ Most people don't appreciate anything worthwhile. __eou__ Haha so true.

How about you? What do you want to do? __eou__ Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway.  __eou__ I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at? __eou__ Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering. __eou__ Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job __eou__ It totally can. Anyway enough about me, you got any cool hobbies? __eou__ Theatre pretty much consumes my life at the moment, but I love it __eou__ Any favorite actors? __eou__ Can I say myself? Haha __eou__ Of course! But who is #2?
Darn straight!  And there's a reason I said "American."  Though it may be inspired by Italian dishes, it was Italian-American immigrants that came up with the dish. __eou__ Really? That's pretty funny. I knew that Italian writers will mock the dish and say it's not really Italian. In Italy it's made only with an egg based pasta. Have you ever had the real stuff? __eou__ Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can! __eou__ Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better. __eou__ I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better. __eou__ You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot. __eou__ Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had. __eou__ I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught? __eou__ Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish? __eou__ Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not? __eou__ Yeah, but I'm sure that didn't include the head did it? __eou__ Don't think it did, what is wrong with eating the head? __eou__ Not much if that's your thing. Never had the desire to try that myself! __eou__ I really like sushi, but I know a lot of people that aren't a fan. You could try vegetarian sushi which doesn't contain fish
My date ended up paying for our dinner. My card got denied __eou__ Oohh...if you're the girl that's ok...if you're a guy c'mon buddy, bring some cash lol __eou__ I gave the cash I had to a homeless guy by the art gallery. __eou__ is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day __eou__ I don't watch much TV. I spend most days painting.  __eou__ TV is good to fall asleep to, i've wanted to start painting but being a nurse keeps me busy __eou__ How do you handle being a nurse, working with so many people? I get so nervous around people. __eou__ I like being busy and helping people is fun. __eou__ I guess I'll always be a shy person. I doubt that my date calls me back. I think you were right. __eou__ Are you going to call your data back?
i am doing reasonably well . how about you ? __eou__ i'm good do you have shoes __eou__ I do __eou__ That's excellent, what's your favorite, I have tons of favorites. __eou__ Probably Nike tennis shoes. __eou__ I love nike designs, their footwear is some of the most comfortable and stylish stuff I've ever worn. __eou__ Indeed it is. The children at the school I teach at always love to see my new shoes. __eou__ That's good. Speaking of good, do you like discovering new restaurants to eat at?  __eou__ mhm. I always try out a new restraunt once a month after work. __eou__ I enjoy dining out as well . what is your favorite restaurant so far? __eou__ El Chico is my favorite restraunt. __eou__ I love eating there as well. The food is always amazing and always up to quality.
I'm great! Thanks for asking. Craving some chocolate. Do you like chocolate? __eou__ I do, I love hersheys choolate, I have been to hershey park in pennsylvania as well __eou__ Awesome! I was so close to there when I was hiking one day, but I had to return home for it was getting dark. __eou__ Haha, I don't like walking in the dark either. __eou__ Indeed, speaking of dark, what type of chocolate do you prefer most? I prefer vegan 100 percent cocoa. __eou__ I like Almond milk chocolate.  I'm glad chocolate has health benefits as well. __eou__ Me too! It contains so many antibiotics, no wonder it was used in medicine many years ago, and today as well. __eou__ Chocolate is not just good for the body, but for the soul as well. __eou__ Very true, the ancients used it very often as a treat. Also, I think I meant antioxidants, not antibiotics...  __eou__ no worries; I knew what you meant. __eou__ Thanks! I'm glad there's someone whom understands chocolate and me! __eou__ Since you like it so much, you should visit Chocolate World if you get the chance. There are shops and restaurants there too. __eou__ Cool, thanks! Perhaps I could hike there someday soon during the spring time. __eou__ Yeah you should go there!
I love that my kids have started helping out around the house now __eou__ That sounds like you have some good help now. How old are they? __eou__ They're 6 and 9 __eou__ That is so neat. Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5? My kids love to binge watch their show! __eou__ Yes they absolutely love it!! They watch it on their tablets in the car! __eou__ That is so awesome. I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it! __eou__ Oh absolutely! It's amazing. __eou__ My 5-year-old twins love it! __eou__ Oh I bet they do! Are they boys or girls?! What are there names? __eou__ A boy and a girl. Thomas and Abigale. __eou__ oh that's adorable. Are they well behaved? __eou__ They are most of the time; Thomas always seems to get into trouble when he comes with me to feed the horses. __eou__ Horses are exciting though, can you blame them?! Mine are just the same. __eou__ Nope; can't blame them at all. Especially since my horses are very patient and good with kids.
Oh thats interesting. Ive always thought kayaks are fun! They are very tiring though, it looks so much easier then it actually is! __eou__ Ha! So many of the paddling-on-the-water past times are like that! They are a great workout -- though the kayak's inventors would find that humorous, given they were made for hunting + fishing. __eou__ Thank's for the info, it would be cool if they make a super kayak with a roof, and motor power. __eou__ it could be like a self paddling pod boat with elaborate comforts . . __eou__ Indeed, and it would sure save on flight and automobile traffic, if more could use the oceans and lakes for travel. __eou__ wouldn't the exhaust fumes pollute more rivers and the ocean, it isn't really helping with cutting down on pollution created by combustion engines. __eou__ True and good point, however, if the engine can run off of solar, and water currents, then there would be less pollution. __eou__ I also know they have another way of storing power by use of pressurized fluid that's in hydraulic hybrids. They are also coming up with newer technologies. __eou__ That's very interesting, thanks. Imagine what the world could look like 10 years from now, phones under our skin, maybe. 
I have high hopes for tonight. I am going on a date __eou__ That is great!  Are you really excited? __eou__ Indeed, but more nervous. Ironic for I teach yoga... __eou__ Hey, I bet that's an interesting job. I actually have never done yoga! I keeping meaning to, but sometimes I hear voices telling me that it's a bad idea! __eou__ Thanks, I teach yoga on weekdays, I work at the red cross other days. I hope this date day goes well. __eou__ I've got my fingers crossed for you! Where are you going? __eou__ Thanks, I'm going to the gym where I used to do yoga a few times a week. I turned it into a living by recording my yoga and teaching. __eou__ Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that. __eou__ That sounds great, I would love too. Also, talking to you has made me less nervous. Thanks. __eou__ definitely ! it was nice chatting with you too ! __eou__ Thanks, I'm almost getting ready to go now. I'm looking forward to that meeting you offered! __eou__ Yes I am looking forward to the meeting too! What are you going to wear to your date?! __eou__ Just casual pants and a shirt, I don't want to feel too awkward too soon. __eou__ Yes good idea!
do you have some asperger i know i do __eou__ no , i don't . i'm a weightlifter , like my mother . __eou__ That's cool! What was the heaviest weight you lifted? __eou__ My max is 180 lbs, but different days I target different muscle groups with different exercises. __eou__ Excellent, thank's for letting me know. I remember taking protein supplements back in the day, they were sorta good. Do you take any?   __eou__ Yes, I enjoy the peanut butter protein powder a few times a week.  I also like to eat clean and meal prep. Do you meal prep? __eou__ Cool. I enjoy cocoa and milk as a source of protein. I used to meal prep often before going to class.  __eou__ its almost the hollidays. You're combination reminds me of hot chocolate. I just drink the protein shake before working out. What did you study? __eou__ Thanks, I usually heat the combination, and thus the drink is a healthier 3 ingredient hot cocoa, water, milk cocoa. I studied math and art.  __eou__ That's awesome. I was terribel at math. __eou__ Thanks. I think I did a bit better in art than math. __eou__ Nice. I always did pretty well in art.  How long were you in school? __eou__ Thanks! I was in school for about 2 years, almost... __eou__ That is a while. Do you work now? __eou__ Yes, and its very fun. Thanks!
Yes. It is very crowded, and busy but I love it. The music is amazing! __eou__ The ultra music festival is usually in downtown Maimi.  __eou__ Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars. __eou__ i only like toyota vehicles. I have a corolla and they drive amazingly, __eou__ I had a corolla for several years too. I want to get a Tacoma pickup soon. __eou__ Nice - They are very fun to drive. I love these music festivals though.

We are doing a taco bar for dinner. __eou__ I love that - Have you ever heard of "Walking tacos"? This is where you take an individual bag of doritos or fritos, and have all of the fixings.
Got a Costco cake. For myself. __eou__ Oh wow, was it good __eou__ It was great. I enjoyed eating it while listening to Bach, __eou__ cool ! i'm listening to bach now __eou__ Really. Do you enjoy other classical composers? __eou__ Bach is very good, he is regarded as of of the greatest of all time. __eou__ I am aware. I like all things classical. I really enjoy going to museums to view art. __eou__ I enjoy museims too. They remind me of my mother who died when I was young. __eou__ I bet that was hard. Do you still struggle with that loss? __eou__ I do stuggle. Her favorite color was blue so that is now my favorite as well.  __eou__ That makes perfect sense.  What a lovely way to keep her memory alive. __eou__ Thank you so much. Is your mother alive too?
I have and I believe it is normal. I actually have depression which isn't normal but i take medication. __eou__ It is odd to me that we consider depression a mental illness, maybe the word is what throws me off. People need and should be encouraged to get treated regadless __eou__ why do you think depression isn't a mental illness?  __eou__ I think it falls under a mood disorder and has different characteristics from mental illnesses __eou__ such as?  __eou__ Well, sometimes my art students are depressed and it takes a few days but they snap out of it.  __eou__ and sometimes someone stays in bed for 2 weeks. There is clearly something wrong  __eou__ Mental Illness and depression are difficult to deal with when you are isolated __eou__ there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to mental health because for the longest time we as a society ignored it  __eou__ Recognizing the reality of mental illness has made life better for many people as they now have access to the proper medication and therapy.
My interest rate just went up on my credit card. __eou__ Yikes, did you miss a payment? __eou__ Yes, I defaulted on my son's car payment.  __eou__ Oh, no, that's terrible.

That's cool! I work in a factory. Do you work at one too? __eou__ I have before, I worked in a dice factory in Las Vegas when I was younger __eou__ That is so cool. Was the work difficult? __eou__ No, it was just boring painting the sides of dice all day. __eou__ That does so sound boring. I would work during the night shifts. __eou__ What factory do you work in? __eou__ We make showers and sinks. I sleep all day after my shift. __eou__ That sounds like hard work.

I can read minds! __eou__ Okay, what am I thinking now? __eou__ I sense....a presence. Have you recently lost a loved one? They are trying to contact you. __eou__ Thats correct!

Do you spend much time with your family then? __eou__ I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted.  __eou__ Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am __eou__ I am just worried about getting into a great college and getting far away from here __eou__ What worries you about it? Do you think you'll make friends easier in college? __eou__ I do think I'll find people on the same wavelength on which I am.  __eou__ I understand.

Oh God no! I can't stay tied down to one woman. Why would you want to do that? __eou__ I know right? Most people consider marriage to be involving 2 people but in certain parts of the world that varies between cultures and religions, so it doesn't seem so bad! __eou__ Marriage is very good.  __eou__ I agree, but in some cultures, marriage is recommended and unmarried folks are frowned upon! __eou__ I agree __eou__ Then again if you consider having multiple spouses, that could make things easier on a family. A tribe right there at home __eou__ We also consider __eou__ I think people though are naturally jealous so having a family union of 4+ consenting adults can be near impossible  __eou__ Yes that is correct

I was in the Army, but I got out several years ago. __eou__ That is a tough choice of career. Thank you for your service.  __eou__ I appreciate that. It's funny though, I was in combat, but now I drive a Prius, not a typical army vet car, according to some.
That is cute! I love eggs. They are high in iron and b12 so they are good for me, since I don't get those from meat like omnivores do. __eou__ Yes, and I know the word 'ovo' means egg in Latin.

I am a waitress, personally. __eou__ I was a waitress in college.  My height gave a lot of looks as I am over six foot tall. Everyone mentioned it. __eou__ I bet you have a lot of people at the grocery store asking for you to reach for things on the top shelf. __eou__ Every time I walk in the store I am ready for someone to ask for help.

I once saw a guy that I SWEAR was a vampire. __eou__ I don't like to be touched so it was very scary for me __eou__ I go on hikes sometimes, and the thing I hate the most is when a spider web that I don't see catches on my face.

I felt very proud of my mom when she put herself aside to be a caregiver for others. __eou__ What does a caregiver do? __eou__ A caregiver is someone who takes care of people who cannot ordinarily take care of themselves. __eou__ I did a little bit of that when I was in college.  I took care of a few autistic adults.  It was emotional. __eou__ That must have been an interesting experience. I've read about adults with autism, it sounds quite difficult. What did you learn from the experience? __eou__ One thing was how big their personalities could be.  My guy was hilarious.  He told great jokes! __eou__ That's very interesting.

I feel for you and kids now a days.  I feel like it is much harder for young people now.   __eou__ Especially as you get older its harder I have no clue what people are even saying with the lingo. __eou__ you mean older ppl (like me) or those younger than you __eou__ in general people younger than me but I'm almost 40 so it's a different world than the one I grew up in __eou__ Yes I see what you mean.  There are alot of nuances to communication texting and PC communication has added. __eou__ yea and now smart phones are everything!

it can be tough . got to stay strong though . __eou__ i couldn't figure it out . math is just to hard . __eou__ I agree! Math is way too hard. If you need help you can always ask though! __eou__ That's true. What are you studying math for? __eou__ I had to take some math classes to finish my nursing degree. I only took them because they were mandatory though. Why are you studying math? __eou__ I'm hoping to go into engineering. So I better improve my math! Don't want to be serving tables forever. __eou__ You can do it! I'm more of an athlete. I have travelled lots for competitions which was great. Have you travelled anywhere? __eou__ Last year, I went to Belarus. It was really interesting, the country is almost lost in time. Have you ever been to Eastern Europe? __eou__ That's awesome! I'm truly jealous. I would love to do more travelling but it's so expensive. Did you travel alone or with friends / family?  __eou__ I went with a friend from my university. I enjoyed the food, but I definitely missed American cuisine too. __eou__ That's awesome!

hi __eou__ You should read the instructions before you start.. You need to work off the prompts.. But hello, __eou__ ughhhh i was proud that i graduated but i don't do anything with my degree __eou__ Well you should be proud of graduating.  Why didn't you do anything with your degree? __eou__ Because whenever I get an interview they always say "we decided to move forward with someone else". It's too much work to keep going to those stupid interviews anyways.  __eou__ Well you will never get in if you don't keep trying?  What are you doing instead? __eou__ Just watching Shark Tank. They have it so easy. I just have to think of something that'll sell and then I'll never have to work!  __eou__ Well that seems like a lot of work and a little risky but I am sure you can think of a good idea __eou__ I know right? It's why I can't think of anything. I wish that I was more imaginative and could think of something. What do you watch?  __eou__ well I like Naked and afraid but I would never do the show.  I have problems with interviews too when they see my hair __eou__ OMG that's so much work. And what's wrong with your hair? I bet you have nicer hair than me though  __eou__ Really?  My hair is blue and orange right now __eou__ like Auburn? Do you watch college football? I love Auburn's team  __eou__ I watch some college football but not a lot.  My hair is blue and orange now but will be pink and purple next

Why there? __eou__ My family is from Perth __eou__ Wow, and how did you end up in Houston? __eou__ My boyfriend is in the military and it was this or Fort Worth __eou__ I see.  Ive never met anyone from Australia here in states. __eou__ We have an accent so I'm told but I think people here have the accent :D __eou__ Yes we definelty speak differently, I love an Aussie accent!! __eou__ Try listening to an old Australian man from the outback and you'll need a robot translator __eou__ I was wondering if there were different sub languages or dialects __eou__ Oh yes. But the older and more sun baked you get, the more it becomes like an ewok village the remote places lol __eou__ Are than many... dialects?
You seem to know a lot about it. I chose the topic because I don't know anything about it.  __eou__ Yeah it's the chat process that works on a client/server model. It's a network chat. It's very interesting. Do you want to now more? __eou__ Not really. Let's talk about food. What do you like to eat? I LOVE fish  __eou__ I like fish too.  But really I am not picky.  Do you eat a lot of fish? __eou__ I eat pretty much only fish. My parents do too, and they're both over 6 feet. Probably cause of the fish LOL  __eou__ Possibly.  How do you like to prepare your fish? __eou__ I LOVE salmon. Sear it with some rosemary, lots of butter, and some lemon. to DIE FOR.  __eou__ That sounds wonderful - what do you like for side dishes?  I eat lots of veggies __eou__ Some shittake mushrooms and asparagus stirfried with olive oil - I'm a big keto fan so it suits fish  __eou__ I like the way you think - and EAT!  Sounds very healthy __eou__ I'm just worried about where I get my fish - sometime i get scared about mercury and other toxins  __eou__ Yes, I have that worry too - you can never be sure, can you? __eou__ It's why I pay extra for wild salmon and organic stuff - call me a health nut but when I'm 95 who's laughing? LOL  __eou__ 95? That's amazing.  Maybe you should write a book
I watched a sports game the other day and it was crazy. they came back after a large deficit. __eou__ That sounds like a good game to watch! Did you have your friends over? __eou__ I usually watch matches with relatives. It's sort of a family tradition! __eou__ That's awesome! Family traditions are the best! Did you do anything for Halloween? It was an excuse to eat chocolate for me. __eou__ I bought a lot of candy to hand out, but not many kids showed up! So now I'm stuck with a lot of chocolate, and way too much candy! __eou__ Hey, that sounds like a win to me! More candy for you! What do you like to do for fun? __eou__ I play for my college's basketball team. Between that and my studies, I don't have much free time. What about you? __eou__ That sounds fun! I'm pretty busy with studies too but i like to geocache with my boyfriend. What do you study?  __eou__ That's really cool. I'm studying education, hoping to become a teacher. What are your career ambitions? __eou__ Cool! My boyfriend is in education as well and is on his first placement. I'm in my senior year of psychiatric nursing. Are you enjoying it? __eou__ Very interesting. I am enjoying it, yes. I'm a bit nervous about entering the job market though. Congrats to your boyfriend! What got you interested in psychiatric nursing? __eou__ Well we always need new amazing teachers so I'm sure you'll be fine.

I'm sure you will make a fabulous teacher and I wish you the best!
I was training a new employee at work last night. She seemed pretty competent. __eou__ That's great. How did she do by the end of the day? __eou__ Well she was doing quite well with putting books on the shelf at least. __eou__ So she should be good to go. AT least she isn't like me, 2 years pre med, 2 kids, divorced. I wish I had a job that calming! __eou__ Well working as a librarian can be calming for the most part for sure. Sometimes that quiet time gets annoying though. __eou__ I am not used to the quiet! It must be a lot of organizing for you every day. __eou__ I haven't been working here long so it isn't bad so far. I imagine I'll get tired of the sorting eventually though. __eou__ yes! Yin and yang, balance in all things. You'll do great there. __eou__ I love the learning part. Like just the other day I ran across this book "Swimming for Dummies" which was terrific since I don't know how to swim! __eou__ i think you might be able to teach yourself but its better to get professionally taught. __eou__ You might be right about that. Being an adult, I have so much anxiety over water as a result. __eou__ oh yes anxiety is a terrible thing, you are brave to deal with it. It won't take that long and you'll be squared away __eou__ Yep, or at the bottom of a lake somewhere. So how was med school anyway? __eou__ honestly it was boring! The hours are brutal. It's nice knowing I am able to save lives and help others
I didn't know that! What savory flavors are there? __eou__ Yorkshire, black, suet and steak and kidney. Not flavors I'd be going for. __eou__ What is Suet, it is birdseed here. __eou__ It's a herb mixture here but it makes me gassy so I don't eat it often HA __eou__ and Yorkshire, kidney meaning organ or legume? __eou__ kidney like in the organ __eou__ Yuck!! __eou__ Yes, quite gross.  Let's talk about some other kinds of food.  What is your favorite? __eou__ I love to cook, try to stick to veggies and chicken or fish mostly __eou__ Really, Do you have favorite recipes or do you try new recipes out all the time? __eou__ Well I would love to hone indian cooking skill, but not loving my creations at all. __eou__ I think indian cooking would be difficult to master - lots of unique spices __eou__ right!  We had an indian grocery, I loved to go in, but it closed down. __eou__ Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  We have one here that has been open for a long time
Last month I had to give a speech in front of a lot of people. I was nervous when I first found out. __eou__ Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out? __eou__ It went better than I expected. It was a really good crowd. __eou__ That's great that it went so well! Props to the crowd too! __eou__ Yeah, thanks! Have you always felt anxious, or is this a recent thing in your life? __eou__ I've always dealt with it, especially when it involves a lot of people. I'm hoping it gets easier though! __eou__ I'm sure it will. I've found that spending time with animals really helps to calm me down. __eou__ That's a really good suggestion. Thank you! I have found that spending time with animals definitely helps me relax. __eou__ Do you have any pets? __eou__ Yes, I do! I have two cats. They're great! How about you? __eou__ I've got a bulldog. He's hilarious, super lazy. Never likes to go for walks! __eou__ Aw, bulldogs are very cute! I can relate to the laziness haha. My cats are lazy as well.  __eou__ That's too funny. How old are they? __eou__ One is six years old and the other just turned 2 yesterday actually. How old is your bulldog?
That sounds fun!  I never dance though, I have two left feet. __eou__ I'm pretty clumsy myself!  I started dancing just because a friend pushed me to.  There a lots of local dance communities around that will teach you step by step. __eou__ Honestly, I don't care much about looking good while I dance. I just like to have fun! What do you like to do for fun? __eou__ too experienced for me . i have 2 left feet . __eou__ That's okay. You can't be good at everything! Do you have any plans for this weekend? __eou__ We have been away past 2 weekends and I just want to be home, plus i'm sick. __eou__ That's understandable. It's nice to relax at home. I hope you get better soon! __eou__ Yes me too, I have been sick with cold going on 4 weeks. __eou__ Yikes that's a long time! Have you been to a doctor?  __eou__ I was actually the first week and had my flu shot then. __eou__ Oh okay. Hopefully they get the flu shot right this year. I still have to get it. Did you celebrate Halloween yesterday? __eou__ I was home sick, but we had trick or treaters! __eou__ That's good! Hopefully you'll be healthy for Christmas at least! Have you started shopping for that already? __eou__ Not yet, have you?
When did the profession actually become officially one? __eou__ They have been around for along time. I think Welders are extremely important. They have to have good dexterity and very good attention to detail. And be very knowledge on the material they are welding. __eou__ all workers are talented in their specific field __eou__ They are. It takes a lot of time to learn new skills, but not all are rewarded equally. __eou__ yes. obviously everyone are gain knowledge through experience __eou__ exactly! That is why I'm learning how to be a welder through gaining experience in practical training. __eou__ sounds good. all the best for your work __eou__ Thank you! I hope that one day I will be able to weld together metal rollercoaster structures. __eou__ thats seems good __eou__ it is. Do you have a favourite rollercoaster park? __eou__ not have any specific park but I like to ride big rollercoaster __eou__ I like rollercoasters that have lots of loops in them. __eou__ yah that move our soul to the peak! __eou__ yeah! But I'm scared of heights, so I don't like it when they have steep drops.
Im not excited about this semester at all. __eou__ Why and what did happen? __eou__ I don't like my roomates __eou__ What's going on with your roomates? __eou__ They are immature fist time away from mommy, alot of partying and debauchery. __eou__ What's your age compared to your roomates?  __eou__ LOL, we are same age, but not the same level of maturity LOL. __eou__ I can completely relate to that. I am a 1st grade teacher and some of my students are more mature.  __eou__ Do you like teaching?  I am thinking about it? __eou__ I love to teach, it's very rewarding. What grade would you like to teach? __eou__ I don't know yet, I like english and history.  I am nervous about the field in general __eou__ Maybe your roomates are adding to the stress. Can you change your roomates?  __eou__ Could be, I am am off focus.  Not easily.  I have been spending most of my time at work or library. __eou__ Well, the library is a good place to start. Maybe the librarian can help you better define your carer focus.

I was looking for something with plenty of space. __eou__ Yeah I bet it's useful for shopping and fitting all your friends and family into, right? __eou__ It's perfect for that! Can fit the entire family with no one complaining about it being cramped. __eou__ I bet! Having a car like that would make me want to go on a long road trip! __eou__ Oh its so good! I like listening to rock music and just finding new roads to drive on! __eou__ rock music is great for listening to while driving! I also really like to listen to korean pop music because it has a catchy beat when you're driving.

I wonder how long until he's called up. __eou__ It is truly amazing when you see that in person. __eou__ I'm really jealous. I can't go to ball games because I'm always looking after the kids. __eou__ Maybe you can have a nanny take care of the kids and we'll go to the ball game together. __eou__ Haha that's a good idea!

It is about 20 minutes in bicycle.  __eou__ That sounds like an awesome job! I love kids. Do you have any of your own or want any in the future? __eou__ I don´t  have any kids yet. But I want to some day. Do you have kids? __eou__ Yeah I have two kids! A one year old boy and a 3 year old girl. No regrets! What do you like to do for fun? __eou__ Those are great ages! I love outdoor activities in my big yard. I like BBQ and playing cards or just chilling in summer. __eou__ Oh man that sounds so nice! I'm looking out my window at the snow and missing summer. Do you live somewhere hot or do you get snow too? __eou__ I get a lot of snow, Which I find interesting too, but also miss summer. Where do you live? __eou__ I live in Canada.

I'm eagerly waiting on a bigger self-employed paycheck by the end of this month.  Whoopeee __eou__ Congratulations! what do you do? __eou__ I got a job as an account, I've been here for three months now. I'm crushing it :-) __eou__ Wow Congrats! I recently got a job as a radio host! I love it. __eou__ Interesting! what time of day do you work?  __eou__ Usually early mornings because that's when people are commuting to work. What about you? __eou__ that's the only time of day I listen to the radio! My hours are regular office hours. I am really enjoying my new gig. sounds like you are too?  __eou__ Ahh so the typical 9-5? My husband is the same, but he usually works overtime by having to go to corporate dinners haha. Yeah I love it. __eou__ Yep exactly. Do you get lots of people calling in to your show?  __eou__ Not usually, people only really call in for the competitions we run.  __eou__ ah ha. I've actually called in and won on radio shows before! do you get decent vacation time?  __eou__ Really?! What did you win? Yeah, it's the standard amount you'd expect really, but every day feels like a holiday when you love your job :) __eou__ I totally agree! You gotta do what you love, find the right mix of people! I've won concert tickets! __eou__ Wow really? To see who? I recently went to see BTS live, that was absolutely amazing. I love any type of pop music haha. __eou__ I love live music! I've actually won concert tickets multiple times if you can believe that!
if i want some solar energy , it will be 10 more and my average pay is 232 . __eou__ i assume you'd add 23 . 20 to 232 for a total of 245 . 20 __eou__ Well, those are all numbers. __eou__ that's true. in theory the numbers work, but you can only know for sure once the solar panels are installed. __eou__ I'd love to have the panels but math isn't my strong point. __eou__ maybe a qualified electrician in the field can help you crunch the numbers. __eou__ that would be most good. __eou__ now, i need your advice. my mom is allergic to dogs and i've got two dogs as pets. how can i make my home inviting for mom? __eou__ Can the dogs be put in another room when she visits? __eou__ i do that already, though she still gets symptoms. maybe i can use solar power to power a uv allergen zapper. __eou__ Now that's a new idea! I love it. __eou__ since we both would like to install panels, I think we should arrange for the same company to do the work. __eou__ Do you know anyone who's had it done? Someone who could offer recommendation? __eou__ Yes, my brother had his whole house off grid with Green Solars Energy. Great company and affordable.
Last Monday I lost my keys at  the mall and couldn't find them. __eou__ That must have been so stressful.

Don't live there.  I am in the midwest __eou__ Well anyway thanks for the offer, my son Owen is out trying to find them __eou__ I am really not sure I understand what you mean. __eou__ We live in New York and i don"t think your Grandmother can help __eou__ I agree, I don't think she can help.  Maybe a long walk around the mall and I will be able to find them __eou__ That is a good idea __eou__ Yes, amazinfg when you retrace your steps what you will find __eou__ Maybe you go to the lost and found at the mall and see if any body found them  __eou__ that is a good idea!  Thank you.  I appreciate tyhe suggestion __eou__ You are quite welcome

I'll look for openings __eou__ well now most provide on-the-job training.so you will get all the training you need there __eou__ sounds perfect! my other alternative would be working at Costco...after all, it's my favorite place to shop! __eou__ I love going to Costco. __eou__ Me too! I need to head over there and check out some of their stuff for Christmas! __eou__ You should - it has something for everyone. __eou__ Yep, I heard they already have the sleds out!

It's so cold right now and my friends are refusing to turn on the heating in our student house so I'm freezing. How's Canada? __eou__ Omg! What's wrong with them? I hate being cold. Canada's alright. Starting to get cold here too. What's England like? I'd like to travel there!
I love flowers too.  Roses are pretty special.  There is nothing better than someone buying you a bunch of beautiful flowers! __eou__ Oh yes!

I appreciate you. __eou__ I appreciate all the servicemen and servicewomen that care about our nation as you do. Does the military let you grow long hair? __eou__ not sure what the exact standards, rules are __eou__ I ask because I am thinking of serving too, but my hair is long and brown and beautiful. I'd prefer to keep my hair long. __eou__ Maybe you could ask a recruiter.  Serving my county is one of my greatest joys __eou__ Great idea. I know that all are great choices, but what branch of the military would you recommend? __eou__ I think the Coast Guard is the best, but many people rather the marines __eou__ My brother served in the Coast Guard and he really enjoyed helping with rescue missions in Alaska.

Where do you get yours from? Order online? __eou__ no I buy herbs freshly on grocery stores __eou__ That's great. Fresh is always a better option. __eou__ Yes I always prefer a fresh one __eou__ Sometimes I grow my own herbs __eou__ that very nice.do you own a land __eou__ No, I grow them indoors __eou__ that's great idea __eou__ It can save you some money.

Have you always lived in the city? __eou__ Yes, we've been in the same house for the past 10 years but decided to move to a bigger house to start a family. __eou__ You'll need a bigger house for that, for sure!

Two are already off to college and the youngest opted for trade school.  The house seems a little bigger now. __eou__ I can see how it might feel that way, but at least you have raised your children well and I'm sure they will have successful careers!

Maybe watch YouTube videos? __eou__ That's an awesome suggestion! I have never thought about that before. I might have to google that to see what I can find. __eou__ I will look into it as well. You can find almost anything is online these days! __eou__ That's true. I feel like I rely on the internet too much sometimes.

I pretty much use it in a daily basis for basically everything!!  __eou__ Me too. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself if I don't have my phone on me. And since I've had kids, it just feels safer having one. __eou__ I know.. I have a kid myself so I always make sure that I have my phone on me no matter what

We might end up with an artist! __eou__ You never know! Hopefully they don't turn out like me... I'm a recovering alcoholic and I was living in a storage locker for two months. __eou__ that sounds rough. Are things looking up for you now? Are you going to AA? __eou__ Yes, I'm attending AA every Sunday. Luckily I'm in an apartment now too, things are finally starting to go my way. __eou__ That's great...I was going to ask about your living situation. It must feel good to be in your own place.  __eou__ Yes, it's so nice to be able to have somewhere to come relax. __eou__ oh, I bet! and I'm guessing the heating/ac was not great in the storage locker? How is your job going?  __eou__ It was always freezing! It's going good, I'm working the night shift at a gas station right now.

They are hard to come by but sometimes you get lucky! __eou__ oh that sounds cool! I wish i had one, dragons are awesome I collect anything with dragons on them __eou__ What's the coolest dragon collection item you have?  Dragons are really cool but I feel like it would hard to find collectibles for them. __eou__ I love small figures and paintings 
I feel like those sports are basically the same thing except with different size balls. __eou__ I'd almost agree except for the pitching in women's fast pitch softball. The technique of the pitcher in that sport is quite dramatic. __eou__ Yes it is quite different but they realy are fast __eou__ Yes, I have played fast pitch softball...pitching gets really tiring though. I love playing softball and I watch a lot of sports too.  __eou__ Ya I like to sit down with a bowl of jelly beans a watch a game __eou__ so you don't go for the chips or pretzels? I want to come watch a game at your place! __eou__ Ya I know it is different but hey come on over and try it out __eou__ What sports do you play? I know I told you I love softball, I love basketball too __eou__ Mostly basketball and volleyball and some tennis __eou__ I tried skiing too but it wasn't for me. what else do you do for fun?  __eou__ I like to play music __eou__ I love listening to music, not so much playing it...what instruments do you play?  __eou__ I play the guitar and banjo __eou__ that sounds awesome. I really like the sound of the banjo. I was thinking of trying to play the ukelele, I like that sound too.
i also deeply love my pets __eou__ what pets do you have ? __eou__ i have 2 dogs __eou__ That's so cool! I have a shih tzu and a poodle, What breeds are your dogs? __eou__ I have a Chihuaha-Dachshund mix and a husky __eou__ Oh, I love huskies! They are very intelligent. Are you thinking about getting any more dogs? __eou__ I'd love to but I don't know if my boyfriend will let me yet. Are you going to get more? __eou__ Probably not, because my husband works in sales and is always away. I would need a lot of help with a new one. __eou__ same here, they can be quite a handful! __eou__ What does your boyfriend do for a living? __eou__ He works with computers, building them __eou__ That's interesting! I'm sure he's a very smart guy. I can barely figure out how to get onto the internet. __eou__ same here! I'm clueless about technology.  __eou__ So I assume you are in a different line of work than your boyfriend. Yes?
yeah had a lot of things like that happen __eou__ wow that must have been tough __eou__ It was...I struggled for a long time. Getting better now. Did you have anything similar happen?  __eou__ Yeah, but it got better over time __eou__ You know what they say, time heals all wounds. I think that's true, it's just that sometimes it's a LOT of time __eou__ I agree. some things take longer than others to get over. __eou__ Yes, I'm trying to look towards the future now. I'm trying meditation and it does help. What will you do for the holidays?  __eou__ Meditation is cool. I've tried it a few times. I'm not sure yet. Hopefully nothing. __eou__ I'm planning to spend as much time as possible with my family. Those are the best times for me. / __eou__ How sweet. I am not close to my family. I always enjoy seeing people having good family time. __eou__ Well, then I hope you get a lot of time to relax and chill. Seen any good movies lately?  __eou__ Not particularly. I am not a big movie watcher. Do you enjoy movies? __eou__ I prefer reading but I do watch some movies once in a while. What do you do for fun?  __eou__ I love to read. I mainly just like playing video games and drinking a little beer on the weekends. __eou__ Yes, I am for sure a regular at the local library!
these people at work are so disrespectful and racist!! I can't wait till i quit! I'm an armed guard and they want me to help customers to find products and i'm not there for that!! __eou__ Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job. Maybe they ask you for help because you're the only one around? It doesn't hurt to help those in need. __eou__ but what if there is a security issue and I'm off helping someone find a product? that could be a really bad situation. __eou__ Do they not have enough security staff available so that you can help customers? __eou__ It's not my job to help customers. I am the only security person. __eou__ That is true! I think you're in the right here, clearly. What sort of job would you like to do if this does not work out? __eou__ I honestly love security, I'm a really big guy, 250lbs and really muscular, maybe I'll become a bouncer.  __eou__ Would you have a day job as well if you became a bouncer or security guard that works at night? __eou__ probably just spend more time with my dogs. what do you do? __eou__ I am currently a student, but I am working towards my dream of becoming a fashion designer. __eou__ oh that sounds exciting!  __eou__ Yeah! I would like to create a more affordable stylish brand that looks similar to LV or Gucci. __eou__ I like that idea. Even though i'ma big guy i really like fashion __eou__ I was going to say something earlier but maybe you could be a model for my future stuff! You did say you're big and muscular.
i do not find much time for it . i do not imagine you do either ? __eou__ i actually like to craft when the kids are at school __eou__ I think daycares are underrated. They let kids have so much expression and creativity and the employees should be paid more for that. __eou__ Yes I agree most daycare workers are underpaid it's a very difficult job  __eou__ Agreed! Kids require patience that it seems like many of us don't have. __eou__ another thing I think that can be under estmiated is the fact that a lot of kids come from broken homes and have emotional trouble __eou__ Exactly! Its heart breaking, and i hope daycares are well aware of that when some kids acta certain way. __eou__ maybe it would help if they had some type of music program, I always found music relaxing and love all types, do You like music? __eou__ Interesting suggestion! I absolutely LOVE music. What genre would you suggest would help? __eou__ I think every genere can help in some way I would love to teach both a mix of clasical and indie mixed togeter like radiohead mixed with mozart __eou__ Fair point. I personally haven't indulged in indie music but now you've got me interested! __eou__ Lol that's cool radiohead is one of my fav, what are some of your fav bands. __eou__ I like this R&B and soul band called the internet. I have a thing for the R&B era! How about you? __eou__ I like the old shool R&B like Aaliyah, Timberland, Usher, and such It's been great talking to You
That must be a hard way to live. __eou__ Psychologists agree that there are positive and negative aspects of it. It really does push me to do better, which is one positive aspect. __eou__ Pushing yourself to do better is always a good idea! Sometimes I honestly feel like I push myself too often. __eou__ It can be really hard. Nobody should push themselves too hard. It can be stressful. __eou__ Well when someone focuses on perfectionism they don't really take into account its affects. __eou__ I agree. Also very hard on the perfectionist person. Hard for them to accept if they don't make their goals. __eou__ Very true, they treat it like it's the end of the world. __eou__ I agree.  Do you set any goals for yourself? __eou__ Yes absolutely. Sometimes I believe my goals are too strict or hard to reach. __eou__ What kind of goals do you set? Like for work or what? __eou__ I set goals around my work and school. With school I force myself to shoot for the stars and I have to follow every regulation at work. __eou__ My daughter just graduated top of her class. She knows what that is like. She is a perfectionist too __eou__ Are you calling me a perfectionist? How could you tell? __eou__ No my daughter. She just graduated high school with honors
he was in a car crash . i only broke my arm . which i've done cycling too __eou__ that is terrible ! i am sorry to hear that . do you go cycling too ? __eou__ I do, but not much anymore. Do you? __eou__ I used to have a dirt bike, but don't anymore either. Some of my family ride in groups and events. __eou__ Why did you stop cycling? __eou__ Mountain biking accident. Couldn't afford to replace my bike afterwards. __eou__ Oh no! That's awful. Did you get hurt in the accident? __eou__  Only my pride was hurt. I have a friend who does some tests to show riding skills and I tried to copy her. It didn't work out so well. __eou__ Oof! What a bummer. Hopefully your pride has recovered since then. :) __eou__ Mostly recovered. I don't think I'll be trying to show off like that again, though! __eou__ I don't blame you one bit. Do you have any other hobbies to take its place? __eou__ I take time on the weekends to hike up in Canada. The views up there are great. __eou__ Oh wow. I've never been, but I'd like to go one day. Friends who have traveled there absolutely love it. __eou__ Yeah you should go! Or to any lake/camping area near where you live. You would have a great time too!
Yeah I know what you mean, I'm not all that great. What drawing techniques do you know of? __eou__ Drawing can involve graphite pencils, ink, pen, brushes, pencils, charcoal, and even electronic drawing. I would love to be able to draw! __eou__ I wish I could draw tattoos! __eou__ It's definitely an art to get good at tattooing, you can't exactly go back and erase a mistake when it's permanent!  __eou__ I know and that's why you need to find a really good artist to get your tattoo done __eou__ What would you say is your best way of finding a really good tattoo artist? I am a designer myself but I don't know anyone who tattoos professionally. __eou__ I have an artist who's been doing tattoos for me for years now __eou__ Cool! I really love how tattooing is becoming more acceptable recently, although I'm not brave enough to get one myself. Does it hurt getting one? __eou__ Yes, little bit but it's worth it! __eou__ Have you ever tried designing one yourself? I have been considering it as there seems to be quite a lot of demand for original tattoo designs. __eou__ You're right! I never tried myself but I thing you should definitelly go for it! __eou__ I'd love to but I'd be too worried that someone wouldn't like my design. Can you imagine if someone said they didn't like it after the tattoo was already finished? __eou__ that would be hard! __eou__ Luckily I think tattoo removals have become pretty advanced these days, a bad drawing has to be better than getting another persons name tattooed on you though!
what kind of dog do you have __eou__ its a collie . its 5 7 , just like me . __eou__ Cool that's nice I love dogs and want to get another A dobermin __eou__ I love dobermans, they are good dogs.

No, I don't know anyone like that!  What do they do with the stuff that they hoard? __eou__ Some hoarders believe that they will be hit by a natural disaster or civil unrest will cause essential items to be in short supply.  __eou__ Well, my mother might be some that believes that... she has 500 pairs of shoes for crying out loud! __eou__ Oh wow. What does she say she wants with all those shoes? __eou__ She just tells me that she can't give them up because he thinks that something awful will happen to me if she does. __eou__ Are they her shoes, or did they used to be yours? That seems a little odd! __eou__ They're shoes that she sees and buys. There are some that used to be mine or my fathers but most are just shoes that she sees at stores. __eou__ Huh, interesting. But she thinks something bad will happen to you if she gives up the shoes? Bad like what? __eou__ I'm allergic to a lot of different things like shellfish, cats, etc. So something like I'll get scratched by a cat and die. Who knows! __eou__ Well, I guess moms will mom as they want! Hahaha. Is her house really cluttered with all those shoes? __eou__ No, I have "left the nest" as they say. My father and mother both live in the town I grew up in. __eou__ Good for you. :) Life happened to me in a pretty rough way, so I'm currently in my folks' basement...but it's a place! __eou__ Hey at least you have your family close by! What happened if you don't mind me asking? __eou__ My roommate committed suicide two years ago, and I couldn't make the bills without her. But my parents let me save money, so I'm glad for them.
I wish I could help my mom out more. __eou__ I am fortunate enough to live close to mmy family so if they need something I can be there. __eou__ That's so great you can be there for them I have found that having family and friends near can really help __eou__ I agree. Its always good to have a support system __eou__ Yep I don't have many friends but I do have a somewhat major friend who actully controls many things __eou__ What do you mean by controls? and I mainly just have my pets __eou__ Well my friend actully runs the world and we even have the fav singer ke ha do You like music? __eou__ Yes I do.

Hello, tell me how the name poodle came about __eou__ Well the origins of the poodle are still pretty disputed. __eou__ What is your opinion about it? __eou__ I think it's strange how they managed to create a poodle from so many mixes of different crosses of dogs. I personally don't like the look of them though __eou__ Me either. what is your favorite breed of dog? __eou__ My favourite breed is probably Husky because of how big they get, although I'm not a fan of how much fur they shed. What's your favourite breed? __eou__ Probably a pit bull because I have one lol.

Do you have a cat or dog? __eou__ I used to have a cat when I was younger which is probably why I prefer them now. My parents have a dog but I don't see him much sadly. __eou__ I also have cats.What is your favorite food? __eou__ My favourite food is pretty much anything you can put on a pizza.

In fact I have heard archaeologists have discovered mummified ancients with metal bands wrapped around individual teeth __eou__ I wonder how they were able to do that fine of metalwork thousands of years ago? __eou__ Beats me... the only reason I know this is because I've been doing a lot of research in hopes I can convince my mom that I shouldn't get braces. __eou__ LOL! I didn't get braces when I was a kid, but I should have. You may not like them now, but it will definitely be worth it years later. __eou__ Yes, but I suppose it's worth it in the long run.  But I hate the idea of having metal in my mouth. __eou__ There are new braces that are clear plastic that you wear at night, they make new ones as your teeth get realigned __eou__ I wonder if those would also help stop food getting between your teeth. __eou__ They might as they cover the teeth, but you mostly wear them while you are sleeping. __eou__ I didn't know if you wore them during the day while you. I tend to be eating all the time. I probably need to stop eating so much. __eou__ Friends that had regular braces did have to watch a lot of what they ate and had to cut some things out. __eou__ I don't think my mom would let me get the clear braces you're talking about. Probably just to embarrass me.
My cat vomited on my shoes __eou__ Eww, did you get angry with her? __eou__ A little but I kept calm I know she did not mean to __eou__ That's good animals are still a little wild lol, probably gonna go for a run in a little get my 2 miles in I do everyday then cook dinner __eou__ Awesome I wish I could be more active.

What's that? __eou__ slowed down on watching it to much these days as I find Immy Fallon somewhat fake but I tune in for the occasional episode member of the band the roots __eou__ I was much more a fan of The Tonight Show when Johnny Carson was on it. The hosts nowadays just aren't in the same league. __eou__ True, I have to go to the eye doctor soon to get some more contacts this saturday but then sunday going to the beach, what about You? __eou__ Cold weather has really hit here, snow flurries with a good frost each morning, so now my indoor hobbies are picking up __eou__ Good time to catch up on some tv Gonna cook pork chops tonight, got premaid rice in the bag but I have to take out the carrots lol __eou__ I have some leftover ring sausage and yams to finish off tonight, probably will toss some tater tots in the toaster oven as well __eou__ I love ring sausage, can't wait till sunday when I get home gonna watch Tv show power any Tv shows you have coming up __eou__ I don't care for too many new shows although I do watch Gold Rush and Expedition Unknown, I don't miss that one __eou__ I like gold rush also Well it was nice talking to You have goodnight __eou__ You also. I do like older shows and just finished watching all four seasons of Route 66, definitely a really good show from the early 60s. __eou__ I'll have to check it out
it is a style of hand-drawn and computer generated cartoons. a little different then what we call animation. __eou__ Yes, I think a lot of westerners strictly view anime as Japanese and that can be hard for some people to get behind. It does have a very different feel to it than our animation like Disney.  __eou__ I really like Justin Bieber.   __eou__ I have a hard time getting into modern music, I like music from the 60s and 70s __eou__ Yeah, that music is enjoyable as well.  I love the old music videos. __eou__ Life was simpler back then. I grew up on cartoons like the Flintstones, these Japanese cartoons are different, but interesting __eou__ I agree.  I can't say that I am a fan.   __eou__ Do you see any of the cartoons that come in the theaters nowadays? Some have been good. __eou__ Yes, some have been very good! i have really enjoyed them! __eou__ I know kids will always want to go see them, but I wonder how much more life they will have in the theaters as they make so many? __eou__ I wish kids would get outside and maybe do horse back riding. I really enjoy that! __eou__ Unfortunately I never got to go horseback riding. But as kids, we were always out riding our bikes or playing ball __eou__ It is a really fun activity to experience. I recommend it highly. __eou__ It's on my bucket list of things to try. A friend I used to work with had a daughter who owned a horse.

Any good recipes you would recommend?  __eou__ Fair enough, I can relate as a student haha. I really like asian food, anything with rice. So maybe fried rice is a good start. __eou__ Thanks, that's a really good idea. It's pretty cheap and I can almost whatever meats I want to it. __eou__ yeah exactly, and it's good to use up vegetables that are about to go bad too. __eou__ That would be true if I ate vegetables haha.

I think many sports are better because of the outside observers. It adds an air of happiness to the entire event, but some sports are better viewed at home. It depends on the sport! What do you think? __eou__ I agree. People have different tastes when it comes to pleasure from just viewing competing events. Ultimately, their well-being will depend on how much they truly enjoy the event __eou__ There's also the element of viewing in public. You can't always see as well as on the TV __eou__ One of my favorite things to watch live is a good chess match.

But no, I'm currently at university :) __eou__ Ohhh that's interesting, what do you study? I loved university so much. Yes there's good holiday pay thankfully :) __eou__ I study politics and international relations, definitely an exciting degree in today's world haha :)  __eou__ Wow for sure! I'm in England so Brexit has been all over the news every day haha. Anyway I wish you luck with it!! :) __eou__ I got fed up with talking about about Brexit, it's just a never-ending story! It's been going on for too long now haha! But thank you!
i am good excited for halloween __eou__ i love halloween . can't get out like i used to i am 77 __eou__ Sometimes the best part of Halloween is staying in and watching some horror flicks, that's what I like to do! __eou__ Horror flicks? Don't you ever get too scared? Haha! I'm not a fan of horrors, much prefer old British comedy tv shows __eou__ I do, but that's the fun of it! Have you ever seen Only Fools and Horses? __eou__ But when the movies finish, are you not scared that some of the horror things may happen to you?? Haha! But yes, I love only fools and horses! __eou__ Nope, I've made it so far in one piece!

Do you like music? __eou__ Yeah, I play guitar mainly. I want to be a music teacher! What's your favorite piece to play? __eou__ Why a music teacher and not a performer? But my favourite piece, hm, I played flamenco guitar - so 'asturias', such a good piece __eou__ I do perform, mostly on weekends, but I really enjoy working with new people who are keen to learn! Figured I could make a more reliable career out of it. __eou__ It must take a lot of patience to be able to teach new people to play! I tried to teach my grandson, but he just didn't want to listen haha
yes , i have a zoo . dog , cat , mice , chickens , and quail . __eou__ that's cool . i have two dogs . i don't like mice though __eou__ Mice aren't as bad as everyone thinks they are. __eou__ I've got a fear of rodents, I don't like them in general. But why do you think that mice aren't as bad? __eou__ They help keep other pests like insects away __eou__ Okay, I agree here. To keep the biodiversity, mice are necessary. But keeping them as pets isn't the necessary __eou__ That's true its not, mine are kids to me. We watch Dr.Who together. __eou__ You watch Dr.Who with mice? Haha, interesting. And have you read Dr.Who books? __eou__ I can't have books, the mice eat the pages. __eou__ That's a shame.

What are your favorite types of books? __eou__ I love reading academic books and books about history! Books about Chinese, Russian and French history are fascinating! __eou__ Do you know how to speak those languages? __eou__ Sadly, I can only read about Chinese history in English, but I can speak the other languages.

The younger generation could learn from them __eou__ Wow, I hope one day I can be with someone that long. Yes they can to many young marriages end in divorce. __eou__ I have several children and I will have to teach them life, so that their marriages can last a long time __eou__ That is a very good idea. I've yet to be married but hope to teach my children the same thing. __eou__ If you're not married yet, don't rush into marriage. It's an important life event! __eou__ I won't my boyfriend and I want to be in a more stable enviroment and financially be able to do so before we go there. __eou__ That is the best approach to take, slow and steady! Especially today, financial stability is key __eou__ Yes it is always better to be financially stable before than to just jump in without swimmies on so to speak. __eou__ I haven't heard this saying before! Is that an American or Australian saying? __eou__ American __eou__ Hello from across the pond then! I'm in the UK 
Oh yea it lasts quite a while so that makes sense __eou__ The word is derived from the Old High German "bacho", meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon" __eou__ Wow, I didn't know that. I think Bacon should be it's own food group. __eou__ Bacon should be, and if you think about it, it's meat candy. It's so versatile as well.  __eou__ I've never thought of it like that but it is. My favorite is using bacon with veggies, makes them taste better. __eou__ Agreed, bacon with green beans is a great side dish. __eou__ I like to wrap it around asparagus topped with cheese. __eou__ Now that sounds really good! I may have to try that some time. Have you ever used bacon mixed with ground beef for a burger? __eou__ Yes I have I add peppers into the mix as well to give it a kick. __eou__ Good trick, what type of bacon do you normally use? I prefer peppered bacon or thick cut. __eou__ I like applewood smoked. __eou__ That's a good type too, perfect on a BLT __eou__ Yes it is, or I crumbled it and make bacon cheeseburger eggrolls. Which is so delicious. __eou__ that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later!

Do you like gardening? __eou__ Unfourtnally I can't grow anything. __eou__ That is unfortunate! I also have to be careful because my cat pickles likes to eat my plants __eou__ That is such a cute name for a cat. I wish my landlord allowed pets, I would love to have a cat. __eou__ He once ate a whole jar of pickles, hence why 'pickles'! You are not allowed to have any pets? __eou__ No the landlord doesn't allow for any pets so that they don't destroy the floors. __eou__ But if you could buy your own carpet and put on the floor, the floor would be protected! __eou__ I never thought of that, I need to bring that idea to them and maybe they will go for it. __eou__ Yes, do so! Using good argument and offering to pay for the stuff on your own always works with landlords haha __eou__ I hope it works, I haven't had a pet since I was a really young child and would love to have one again. __eou__ If you haven't had one, even more of a reason to try! Cats can be so lovely and so low-maintenance, they're great __eou__ I had one when I was little, his name was snowstorm since that's what he reminded me of but my uncle let him run away

But it is a very messy thing. __eou__ My kids love to draw, Just have to make sure they don't eat the crayons.  __eou__ My kids use the crayons on the walls.

Could have been way worse I guess. __eou__ Yeah! I usually take vitamin c all the time just to prevent colds. You should do the same with the kids! Thank god no cold after all that rain. __eou__ Thanks for the tip! Does vitamin C really prevent colds? __eou__ Yeah! and Zinc! It helps prevent them but it does not make much of a difference once you have it. __eou__ Do you think they will ever find a cure for the cold? It's so annoying. __eou__ It mutates a lot! I hope that they will at some point. We have to be careful with all these mutations though.
hi ! __eou__ hi __eou__ how was your day __eou__ My day was amazing! I got to hang out at the beach all day! __eou__ thats cool __eou__ Yeah! I just moved to Florida and I am so excited to be able to go to the beach. I never really got to before. __eou__ the best part of it is going to universal studios to have a blast __eou__ I can't wait to go to Harry Potter World!!!! __eou__ i love that its the best part to the trip __eou__ I can't wait to try Butter Beer and go to Daigon Alley! __eou__ i go there next time i go __eou__ Another thing that I love about living here is how many concerts they have. You know bigger cities and all. __eou__ i love taking pictures everytime i vist i usually paint the pictures captured __eou__ That's a great talent! I wish that I could paint!
Yeah, my mortgage and car loan, I am really up the creek! __eou__ Well in the US we have something called loan modification to help people who are having trouble making payments. Maybe that would help you.  __eou__ That's interesting and could be helpful.  __eou__ I got the loan on my tractor modified after the farm was foreclosed. It helped a lot. __eou__ That sounds good, maybe ill let my husband know about it as im busy at work a lot. __eou__ Definitely worth looking into. I think most companies can provide a quote online.  __eou__ Great!  i like doing things online, its so easy. __eou__ I try to do everything online. Too cold most of the time to go outside. need to move somewhere warmer.  __eou__ oh tell me about it. its very cold where i am from.  __eou__ This time of year the temp just drops. My fault for living right on the Ohio River.  __eou__ Still that's a wonderful place to live. ! __eou__ Oh yeah, some of the best food I've ever had. Still thinking about moving somewhere warmer. __eou__ i would like to move but i have to many responsibilities here with my job as a nurse __eou__ I can't imagine how stressful that must be. It must be very rewarding. 
well , sometimes ! accept country __eou__ country music is great . like to play basketball ? __eou__ yes for fun __eou__ I played in college, not just for fun. Trying to get a little league started at the rec center. __eou__ its tuff i wish you luck.   __eou__ Thanks.

Have you ever been it italy? __eou__ i have been there a couple of times __eou__ How is it? I've always wanted to go? __eou__ its beautiful and its nice to use overall __eou__ What do you mean nice to use? __eou__ i mean its so beautiful and i want to be part of the culture __eou__ Oh I understand. I just can't even imagine how great the good there must be!
Yesterday, I forgot to flush the toilet at work. The look of disgust on my co-worker's face who just walked out was priceless. __eou__ Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens.  __eou__ I'm going to have to do better at remembering to flush next time! __eou__ oh ok will try good best __eou__ Have you ever forgotten to flush? __eou__ just once luckily it was not during a live performance . would have been embarrassed . __eou__ Thank goodness it was not during a performance! I would have been embarrased too! __eou__ yeah . . my coworker is an idiot __eou__ Oh my, I'm sorry to hear that. I imagine that he/she has some good qualities too though? __eou__ i suppose . i am mad at my coworker too __eou__ What happened to make you mad? __eou__ Fired someone with out telling my boss. Two coworkers got in a a fight I perceived opportunity the be the best time to get rid of one. __eou__ Oh my; well hopefully the workplace will be less caustic without the fighting now! __eou__ i felt angry about it . but that was then and this is now .
Do you have any children? __eou__ I do not yet __eou__ I have two children __eou__ oh wow! Do you want anymore, my mom wanted a ton but she's also an osteopath __eou__ I'm not sure, with childcare expenses these days it unfortunately becomes a business decision as well __eou__ I completely agree, thats why I've watied so long. They said that a cost of one kid NOT including college is close to 200,000 __eou__ It is expensive for sure, but the quality of life you obtain through seeing the world through the eyes of children again is priceless.  It keeps you young! __eou__ But its the unconditional love. Kids love you no matter what __eou__ This is true - it's much like pets as well.  And, the ability to shape their minds and lives is a huge responsibility. __eou__ Do you have any pets? I have two dogs. __eou__ I have a dog and a cat - my kids like playing with them as well, and while they do it gives me a chance to relax and read __eou__ Oh wow, and they get along good? I have always wanted a cat but scared about already having dogs. __eou__ They do.  My cat acts like a dog.  And my kids chase them around the yard to burn out energy. __eou__ Do they all sleep together? __eou__ Sometimes, the cat stays outside quite a bit as well.
ohh okay. when did people first start doing rotisserie? __eou__ Its been used in medieval cuisine and early modern kitchens, so a long time __eou__ That is very interesting, do you enjoy it? __eou__ i hate it ! i do enjoy grilling though __eou__ I wish I had the talent, I am a terrible cook! __eou__ If you keep working at it, I'm sure you'd be a great cook!  __eou__ I do enjoy playing the piano though, my ten year old son is coming along to it as well. __eou__ Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own. __eou__ You absolutely should! It is a wonderful experience. I enjoy it very much. __eou__ I agree I should,It would be a fun experience!  __eou__ Youtube is very helpful for picking  up some free tips if you do not wish to commit to lessons right away! __eou__ I like using You Tube to get instructions when I am not sure what i am supposed to do in a  situation __eou__ I feel the same way. I use it much more than I realize I do. Mostly cooking tips for me! __eou__ that sounds very helpful ! are you planning to be a chef ?
dogs are incredibly smart . i bet they could even learn to read __eou__ probably , i talk to them just like they're people __eou__ I do too, they're able to sense emotion so well! __eou__ indeed. especially dogs. it feels like that they read my mind even when I dont speak __eou__ Do you have any pets? __eou__ No, but I must get one to get me out walking. and you?  __eou__ No I don't have any pets either. If I did have one I would get a dog though __eou__ me too, so, I would have to walk it every day.  __eou__ You could definitely get some more exercise that way; I need to exercise more often __eou__ I would hope if you had a dog you would take them for walks. You have space for one?  __eou__ Not really; maybe I should get a fish instead? __eou__ What about the excercise? :) __eou__ Maybe I could put them a travel aquarium and go for walks! __eou__ yes that sounds like a great idea ! you are very creative. 
Last week, my partner's mom passed away. It was truly hard for her to comprehend all the mixed feelings at that moment __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that.  Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life. __eou__ Yeah, I haven't lost a parent yet, so I don't know what to do or say to her. __eou__ Well, I have lost a grandparent as well, and most of the time you don't need to say anything - just be there. __eou__ That's what I've been doing, her family is all coming in, so I've been cleaning and getting food and stuff in __eou__ That's a good way to be supportive - anything to help her - especially to allow her more time with her family.  Does she like to draw? __eou__ Yeah, she does. But I'm a truck driver so I have to leave for a few days too. So hopefully her family will be here to help. __eou__ I would make sure that she has family for support and isn't alone.  Drawing is a good coping outlet for me - I draw my feelings and it helps __eou__ Do you suggest I get her a journal and pencils? __eou__ A drawing journal would be good so she could draw and write out her feelings.  Gives her a healthy way to release them __eou__ Yeah! I think thats great! Even one of those that have prompts for her to write or draw. __eou__ Yeah that's true, what does she usually like to draw?  You might encourage her to draw something she likes also to make her happy. __eou__ She likes to draw animals. __eou__ I always liked drawing animals too - I used to go to the zoo and sit and draw the animals.
ohh, that's what it is. that sounds like fun. how can you grill on the back of your car?! __eou__ Its where you bring a portable grill and lay it on your tailgate, usually on a truck, But most people I know do it even if their vehicles dont have tailgates. __eou__ That sounds like a ton of fun to have with friends! __eou__ its extremely fun! __eou__ What kind of events do you typically have tailgate parties? __eou__ College Football games and Basketball Games are the best events!  __eou__ Sounds like a great time. __eou__ It is if you enjoy being out socially!  __eou__ I do, I missed a lot growing up in foster care system, but I went to community college which I was able to socialize. __eou__ I'm glad you were able to experience socialization, and i'm sorry about your coming up in foster care. I know that can be hard. __eou__ It wasn't easy but I had great supporters.  __eou__ That's great I'm happy you did. You know I've never been on an airplane. Just hit me when thinking about my past. __eou__ I can surely relate! Turbulence can be frightening! __eou__ oh yes i can imagine .
I've been going to a new school for weeks and still don't know anyone. I always eat my lunch by myself. __eou__ It's not good to be stuck alone. I'm sure you can make friends with someone there! __eou__ Maybe I could invite some of my classmates to play ultimate frisbee __eou__ That would be a lot of fun - sports are a great way to meet new friends. __eou__ Yeah they are; are you in school? __eou__ I'm actually in college - I play Ultimate Frisbee on an intramural team __eou__ That's awesome! I'm studying law right, what are you studying? __eou__ Crazy enough - I'm studying Pre-Law and Political Science (Dual Major). __eou__ Oh wow, I bet that's tough. Is it a big workload? __eou__ Yeah it is, but I stay on top of my course work.  If I try to wait till the last minute it gets overwhelming __eou__ I was always bad about procrastinating too __eou__ Yeah, it was a terrible habit I had to break in high school.  I was lucky to always be one of the "smart" kids. __eou__ Yeah, being "smart" is sometimes bad though since it's easy to make bad habits lol __eou__ Yeah, I was always able to get by with just watching/listening to the lectures.  Photographic memory.
My friend won an award i was also going for __eou__ omg that's such an amazing news! good job! what is your next goal __eou__ But I didn't win it- - It was tickets to the backstreet boys __eou__ I seen the backstreet boys back in 93! Good times. __eou__ Have you! I'm so jealous....my 1990's VSCO girl was screaming...I wanted it so bad. Have you ever won an award? __eou__ I have won an award for writing! Such a great feeling. what about you? __eou__ Oh wow, for what? __eou__ A best selling novel.  __eou__ Are you serious??? thats awesome __eou__ Yes! I am working on another at the moment. Have you won any awards? __eou__ I have .... I was a 2 x All- American in college as a javelin thrower. __eou__ Now that is true talent!  __eou__ Thanks- it was a blast! We actually won the team title in 2008 __eou__ That's amazing! That requires so much athleticism. 
I have a son who's 8 months old! I get so nostalgic about how quickly time has passing, and it hasn't even been a year! __eou__ Yeah, it's crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too, having kids must be surreal __eou__ It is, and working for peta makes life even more difficult  __eou__ PETA?  Wow, I bet.  What do you do there?  Kids would be hard enough without work. __eou__ I tend to the animals, being a vegetarian made me appreciate the animals more.  __eou__ I see.  Noble profession.  I was a vegan for several years.  I have reintroduced fish now. __eou__ Fish used to be a favorite of mine, maybe someday I will taste the fine trout again !  __eou__ Yeah, I only eat fresh caught, non-farm raised.  The Real Deal.  Salmon is my preference. __eou__ Ah, Salmon is delicious. Going vegetarian changed all that for me though, now it's plant based only.  __eou__ I get it.  I usually do fish tacos - one of my favorites.  It's also easy and quick to make at college. __eou__ Those are also quite tasty! I miss the days like that.  __eou__ Yeah, you can still eat the guacamole though!  I'm studying to be a doctor.  So, I wanted to be healthy __eou__ That was a great career choice! And yes guacamole fits right into my vegetarianism. Working for peta makes less time for eating though, __eou__ Yeah, I'm sure.  But a working for a good cause is meaningful and rewarding - I couldn't imagine having a boring, meaningless job.
i like reading blogs you can learn a lot __eou__ sometimes i like being alone so the library is perfect . __eou__ I agree. I enjoy reading books, but I can't find a good blog for books. __eou__ I try not to rely on blogs for information. __eou__ Very true. But blogs can be a great place to voice opinions about things that you read. __eou__ Indeed. __eou__ Do you like to read? Fiction? Nonfiction? __eou__ I love fantasy and sci-fi. My friends say my library is arranged well, but I still think it could use some improvement. __eou__ I like fantasy and sci-fi as well. I really enjoyed reading the Game of Thrones series.  __eou__ I've never watched it, but I hear that Game of Thrones is a great show. __eou__ It was a great show, wasn't too happy with the ending, so I'm holding out hope for the books. There are still 2 books that he hasn't released yet.  __eou__ I did not know it was ending, sorry to hear that! __eou__ It's OK. All good things must come to an end right? What about you? Favorite book or series?  __eou__ Wheel of Time is the top one for me, But I also like most of the Brandon Sanderson Novels I've read too. Particularly the Cosmere stuff. __eou__ I'll have to check it out. It was fun talking. Have a great rest of the day
I have no idea what to do, my daughter has been complaining about bullies. I've had meetings with her teachers but the bullying hasn't stopped! __eou__ That is a shame.  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today. __eou__ Yes, I just wish I knew how to help. She is worried getting adults involved is going to make things harder for her. __eou__ Well for sure, but it seems important that she learn the importance of getting adults or authority figures involved. __eou__ Yes , summer vacation is so nice she is not as stressed. I enjoy summer very much. __eou__ Oh indeed!  Though summer also means less structure and possibly fewer support networks.  I'm glad that she she is less stressed.  Is she working a summer job? __eou__ Yes she is working down at the local comic store, which is awesome our favorite hero is The Flash! __eou__ That's great.  Can't say that I know much about comic books, though some are very valuable.  Maybe I should buy some for an investment. __eou__ Would be smart, especially if you know which comics are most rare.  __eou__ I absolutely wouldn't know which comics are rare.  Would your daughter be able to advise? __eou__ I am sure she can do some research and find out! I would guess Classic Joker comics would be a good start. __eou__ Perhaps we'll make a visit to her shop.  My wife likes helping young ladies and I like investing in atypical assets! __eou__ That would be perfect! I know she would be thrilled to have visitors!  __eou__ Absolutely.  We love helping build community.
My best friend's grandmother passed away.  __eou__ Oh my, sorry to hear that. How is he holding up? __eou__ Not well, I'm a yoga instructor and tried showing him some techniques to help him relax through grieving.  __eou__ Great idea, that is good for the body and mind.  Being there for him alone will help - shows you care. __eou__ You have to be there for your friends. Watch a good romantic comedy with them. Get a nice laugh going.  __eou__ True enough.  "Laughter is the best medicine."  I usually watch movies alone though. __eou__ Not myself. The idea of a romantic comedy alone is boring to me. But being alone can be good for the soul.  __eou__ Yeah, I work in a factory so I don't get a chance to talk to many people.  I like being alone. __eou__ Maybe you should take on Yoga. Great activity for when you're alone!  __eou__ I do like exercise - I've never tried Yoga.  Do you have any suggestions on where to start? __eou__ Purchase a book at any book shop. It will show you the basics. Then seek out a professional later for more advanced learning!  __eou__ Ok - thanks for the tip.  I'll definitely have to check that out.  I want to stay healthy.  I hope it helps out your friend __eou__ I do aswell.  Keep his minds off things. Then take him to see a wonderful romantic comedy!  __eou__ Yeah, what's your favorite romantic comedy?  You seem to really enjoy them __eou__ My favorite is Something's gotta give with Jack Nicholson. Woderful Film!  __eou__ I'll have to check it out - thanks!
sunday i am going to a concert and i cant wait __eou__ So exciting, which concert? __eou__ What concert are you planned to attend? __eou__ I love southern rock, though it's rare to get time away from my studies... who are you seeing on sunday? __eou__ I am planning to see Phil Collins in Las Vegas, NV.
I am a huge fan of them as well. Especially Led Zeppelin. Have you ever gone to any of their concerts? __eou__ I wish, I'm way too young, they've been rocking since around 1968. __eou__ Well that's too bad!  You missed out there - do you like any Heavy Metal Music though? __eou__ Yes! That is actually my favorite type of music. __eou__ Awesome.  Do you like going to see concerts live?  They can get pretty intense. __eou__ They can. I think its the best part though! You can really feel the music in your bones.  __eou__ Yeah, agreed - I always feed off the energy from the crowd as well - it becomes a full body experience. __eou__ Truly! I prefer a smaller venue setting as opposed to Music Festivals though, how about you? __eou__ Yeah, I like the acoustics in smaller venues.  Typically though I like unplugged or acoustic performances in smaller venues though.
Me and my mom have always had a trusting relationship. __eou__ That's good to hear, it's always great to have a good relationship with your parents! __eou__ Yes, and by rooting yourself in the Bible, You can have a strong family bond!  __eou__ Yeah, my mom created a strong foundation in the church for me.  We went to Sunday School and the weekly service. __eou__ Being a married man, heaped in religion. The Bible is my favorite book. Which book in the bible is yours ?  __eou__ I'm not sure I understand your question - but my favorite book in the Bible is Psalms __eou__ Yes the Psalms are beautiful. Myself and my wife like reading Psalms before bed for peace of mind.  __eou__ I agree - they've always brought me comfort.  Reading in general before bed does for me.  I recently strayed away some though from the Lord __eou__ We all stray, but by going back to the good book we can find ourselves again.  __eou__ Yeah, that's my goal.  I recently had a mid life crisis and changed my hair blue - I'm thinking of returning to my natural roots. __eou__ My wife would destroy me if i colored my hair blue. But going back to our natural roots is always best. Biblical roots for a strong foundation.  __eou__ Yeah, my family wasn't too happy with me - they thought I was depressed.  I also own blue shoes - thought I had the "blues" __eou__ Even the blues can be healed through the words of Jesus Christ, have faith!  __eou__ Yes, I've returned to the Church, and have been attending weekly Biblical Counseling sessions - they've helped.
My husband threw away a very important document yesterday and I was so mad at himk. __eou__ Oh no! what was it and what will you do? __eou__ I have to travel all the way back to the embassy and apply for its replacement, but anyway,  __eou__ That sounds like a pain. What embassy?  __eou__ Its the British Embassy where I live. It has been a while we moved here and I rather like to enjoy time exploring.  __eou__ Oh nice never been, maybe one day but for now I am enjoying my cabin and fishing on the lake. What was the document?\ __eou__ : my passport proof to use when travelling while the new one is on the way.. Do you go to seaside? __eou__ I do sometime plans in the work for the beach for Thanksgiving\ __eou__ Can you imagine I never learned swimming! :( __eou__ Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement __eou__ Can't dispute. One must spend some time at beach to learn it, isnt it?  __eou__ You can learn to swim at any pool. There is a YMCA in town with a pool. __eou__ Far away from home :( __eou__ Internet can teach some basics even far from home.
that would be great ! tired of working in the family business . __eou__ speaking of family , i have a son , he's 10 . __eou__ I used to work food service __eou__ That's awesome! I would like to become a music teacher. Maybe after retirement. __eou__ That's cool. Having your own business sounds like a good start? __eou__ I agree! I graduated in 86... I may have to go retake some business courses to refamiliarize! __eou__ Oh yeah, I used to work early until 5pm and go to school at night. You could certainly take a refresher! __eou__ I sure hope I still have the brain for it. It's not as zippy as it used to be! __eou__ I know what you mean! I learned business from my family's food business,but that felt like a long-time ago.  __eou__ A lot has changed but good, honest service will always keep a business thriving. __eou__ On another topic, Do you have plans for the holidays? __eou__ Not sure yet, May travel to see family. How about you? __eou__ I wanted to do something, but I'll mostly just take the time to relax and cook.  __eou__ Those plans sound lovely! 
That's excellent! What exactly interests you about financial planning? __eou__ I used to teach, so the idea of teaching individual money management skills is very appealing. __eou__ As someone who works in finance,  I can tell you we need those skilled employees!  __eou__ Yeah, well, like they say - those who can't do - teach.  I wanted to work in Finance - I may try again. __eou__ Working in Finance has it's benefits, I'm sure you'd be a great asset !  __eou__ Yeah, I appreciate it - I think I'll test the waters again - I'm feeling more confident. __eou__ Do you own a car? I live walking distance from the firm and have chosen to sale mine, do you think it was a good idea?  __eou__ If you can walk - for sure - a huge expense that you don't need.  And you get exercise to boot! __eou__ Thanks! I thought I made the right decision. Walking does the body good!  __eou__ Yes it does.  I actually prefer to mountain bike though.  You could always do that as a form of transportation as well.  I would if I could! __eou__ I may try that! It would make the commute quicker even if I am close! __eou__ Yeah - and, if you put a basket on it, you can go pick up some groceries as well. __eou__ Working in finance the hours don't give me much free time, You're absolutly right thats a great idea!  __eou__ Yeah - anytime I can be efficient, I am.  I have kids and there's a lot that I want to do before I die - like skydive.
I did know that.  Even more interesting is in it's meaning.  Yellow stands for happiness, positivity, energy, optimism, enlightenment, and intellect. __eou__ Yes it does, I even liked it in a song, cold play has a song called yellow. Good thing is that the color has a dominant wavelength of roughly 570590 nm __eou__ Yeah, I always liked the Coldplay song Yellow.  Wasn't a huge fan of the rest of their music though. __eou__ thats fair i also like coldplay as well as Radiohead, good english bands. And Korea Bands. __eou__ I love Radiohead though - most of their non-radio songs.  Ok Computer was my favorite.  I used to relax and eat pizza while listening to them. __eou__ Yeah I had Electioneering in my head all day yesterday. __eou__ Great Song - Paranoid Android was my favorite. __eou__ It's hard to believe the record came out almost 25 years ago. Even though I was in my 40s back then, I still loved new music. __eou__ Yeah, a true fan can appreciate good music at all ages.  It's much like my steak preferences - I can always taste a perfectly cooked one. __eou__ Yeah, my social security check doesn't leave much money for steak. May I come stand outisde your house and sniff the air next time you cook? __eou__ For sure - smells are always free! __eou__ Do you put butter on it? I love butter because of the soft yellow shade. __eou__ I do.  I could it with butter, and prefer mine medium to medium rare.  I actually like listening to music while I'm cooking. __eou__ Yes, I find KPop goes well with warming up Vienna sausages __eou__ I agree.  There's a different band for each taste.
not good . i'm trying to lose weight and i'm having trouble doing it . __eou__ i'm ray i just got back from the gym , i go on a regular basis __eou__ I would like to start going to the gym to help me lose some weight, but it's hard to get motivated? Any suggestions?  __eou__ Hi I'm Ray. I am a physical fitness enthusiast. I believe eating healthy and exercising is a important. __eou__ I think exorcise would really help me. What do you use to keep yourself motivated?  __eou__ I am very conscious of my weight, so that is one motivator. Also, I feel mentally better when I exercise. That alone is motivation. __eou__ That's a good point. I need to get on some sort of diet plan as well. I try for a few days then I get frustrated and quit. __eou__ Setting a goal each day is helpful. Even a little exercise and at least one healthy meal each day helps alot; chicken and rice is my favorite. __eou__ I love that idea of setting smaller daily goals. And I love chicken and rice.  __eou__ I started going to the gym once a week, working up to 4 times a week. I also write down everything I eat. It helps to visually see the progress. __eou__ Yeah I could see that. Kind of like banking. Keeping track of everything so I can hold myself accountable __eou__ Exactly! Keeping healthy food in the freezer is also good. I make my favorites (chicken and rice!) and freeze it for easy use. __eou__ Another awesome idea! Thanks! Do you have special containers or something to freeze it? __eou__ I also budget like you! I use freezer ziplock bags so its easy and doesn't take much space. I let them thaw while I'm at the gym or work.
A friend of mine spent all night partying instead of staying home to study. He ended up failing an important exam! __eou__ That is no good.  I bet he regrets it! __eou__ Yes, he did felt bad about failing the exam. __eou__ What class was it?  I just hope it wasn't important to his program of study... __eou__ Yes, it was his final math exam. __eou__ Oh my.... I never liked math.... painting and math just don't mix!  What will he do to recover his grade? __eou__ I think he will get a second chance or make up. __eou__ I hope the teacher allows that.  My painting instructor is certainly easy like that.  Was the party at least fun? __eou__ How long were you painting? __eou__ Well it's part of my major and my favorite class.... so really I paint every semester! __eou__ I have attended a painting in my 7th grade class. __eou__ What did you paint back then? __eou__ We were painting still life pictures. __eou__ Still life is a fine start!  Maybe your partying math friend should consider painting.
it is hard for __eou__ yeah i bet that sounds true __eou__ Yeah, my mother works as a nurse and she recently had a patient die on her - she is struggling. __eou__ My that's awful.  Tragic infact.  Does that happen regularly in her career? __eou__ Yeah, she works at the intensive care unit - so unfortunately - she deals with it often, this one just hit home more  __eou__ I really can't imagine... does she do the early morning shift? __eou__ 3rd shift (nights) - sees all the bad victims - shootings, etc.  This one though she knew the person. __eou__ I can't imagine dealing with the death of someone you knew at those hours in those circumstances. __eou__ Yeah, it was tough for her - and the bad thing is, he was revived twice, but couldn't pull through. __eou__ That's traumatic.  What sent him to the hospital? __eou__ Car Accident.  A drunk driver hit him head on. __eou__ oh my goodness.  that's a tragedy. __eou__ It was - why she's taking it so hard.  I try to play her some rolling stones though to soothe her.  It is our favorite band. __eou__ i'm an opera fan myself, but music is therapeutic.
It does. It has quite an impressive collection of old master paintings, I believe, among other things. __eou__ He started collecting art as soon as he made his fortune, smart __eou__ Yes! Art is always a smart investment, especially since it brings so much joy! Like two for one! __eou__ I went to New York recently to explore my interest in becoming a museum curator. __eou__ Interesting!! What did you explore while you were there? __eou__ I visited a few museums, as well as explored the beautiful city. Do you like to travel? __eou__ Sounds lovely. i love to travel, but I prefer getting out of the city and into the forest. National parks are my favorite places to visit. __eou__ Nature is very peaceful! You can really find yourself on a visit to the national forests! __eou__ Absolutely! As Maxime Lagacé once said, "By discovering nature, you discover yourself". __eou__ Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features __eou__ That sounds like a great premise for an Art Exhibition! __eou__ I enjoy watching art. Maybe I'll hapen across some of it! __eou__ Yes, me too. Being in nauture certainly inspires me to make art! I think thats why I go out to the woods so often.  __eou__ i started taking painting classes recently. Outdoor art would be a fun thing to try!
I have learnt a lot about it but i have never used it before. Is every movie available on it? __eou__ Netflix contains many movies, however they do not contain every movie. They expand their capacity from time to time however. __eou__ What movies do you watch on Netflix? __eou__ I like anything about dogs or islands. you? __eou__ I would like a Cockapoo __eou__ I have a Weimeraner. I like cockapoos, but I need a bigger dog to help around my island. __eou__ What type of help do you need on the island? __eou__ Mostly I need one who can fetch beverages and lie on pool floats __eou__ Haha...that's a smart dog __eou__ Indeed. She also helps pick the movies I watch. __eou__ What are her favorite movies? __eou__ The Air Bud ones. She's really into films with other pups. __eou__ Haha...Marley & Me is a cute one __eou__ Oh she doesn't like it when the dog dies. Growls at the screen. __eou__ I don't blame her. I never watch that part
Wow thats quite a few. Thats cool. __eou__ It's so good. It won a Pulitzer Prize __eou__ good old times :) __eou__ My good old times are the gym for an intense game of raquetball. I joined the team and play any chance I get. __eou__ Ever played it professionally?  __eou__ Not yet but all the time spent at the gym and I probably could. __eou__ Nowadays we see stars coming everywhere. I wish I met a good mechanic nowadays. __eou__ I got my love of the game from watching my dad play hand ball when I was young. Probably where my love of Middlesex came from too. __eou__ If you fancy some antiquity, I could offer you my car :) __eou__ Probably not old enough to be antique yet but my dream car would be a 85' Chevy Silverado
When I was a kid, I got chased down the street by the neighbor's dog.  She was literally nipping at my heels. __eou__ i used to get chased by dogs too , back then when i was younger fences were not to common __eou__ I have a ton of friends, and growing up we used to play in the neighborhood when a dog chased me.  __eou__ Why was the dog chasing you?   __eou__ I don't know/ remember but the bus driver rescued me basically. Funny thing is my name is nick and i could hear the owner of the dog yelling nick. __eou__ That's funny!  Maybe your mom was calling you at the same time. ;) Next time you'll have to throw out a distraction or something __eou__ I know right! I'll just have to keep dog treats on  hand and make a run for it. __eou__ That and take up running!  I got pretty quick once I started running regularly myself __eou__ Actually I do happen to love running, although I don't have the time for it as much. Do run competitions?  __eou__ When I get a chance.  It's gun, but I'm more of a solitary person myself... just me, the road and my fishing pole.  __eou__ Ah, Ok. Yeah nothing beats sitting on a dock or boat and chilling with the sun. __eou__ exactly, a nice day of relaxing is just right.  __eou__ My friends and I used to go noodling - cat-fishing. It's too rough on the body. __eou__ I don't mess witht he cat fish myself.. those barbs can be brutal!  you're pretty brave to do that bare handed imho
I'm excited for school to start and for the kids to get out of my hair for at least some of the day! __eou__ lol! I bet, how old are they? __eou__ They are 14 and 12, I hate cleaning so this should make my life a little easier!  __eou__ Oh, poor you! But once they become full adults things will be easier! __eou__ True but i work a full time job in finance. So things are never that easy.  __eou__ I,m working as a librarian full time.Also on Satuirdaymornings. __eou__ That's a lot of hours. Saturdays used to be my cleaning days, I hated them.  __eou__ Oh,I don't really mind working on Sat.morning. I love talking to people. __eou__ Working in finance all my conversations are about money, So it can be a bit boring.  __eou__ Yes! I understand that! My conversations are not about books and writers alone. I know a lot of those people. __eou__ My conversations are always business related. In the finance world it's all about the Benjamin's  __eou__ You just reminded of my favorite song of Breaking Benjamin  __eou__ Breaking Benjamin is a great band! So Cold is a fantastic song! I can almost clean when I listen to it!  __eou__ That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe.
hi i just got finished listening to an extraordinary band marduk __eou__ sounds fun ! what other music do you like ? __eou__ I'm getting into a lot of Swedish bands now that I live here. __eou__ That's awesome, I'm more of a book guy. Music is my second love. Reading comes first. But I do love a good tune.  __eou__ Really? If you like nonfiction you should check out Melanie Dotcity __eou__ I will do that it sounds great! I love true stories! What color is your hair? Mines brown. Sorry it's been on my mind.  __eou__ Mine is also brown but it has reddish highlights when I'm out hiking on glaciers __eou__ That sounds beautiful! So you live in Sweden then ?  __eou__ Yes, I moved here from Florida __eou__ I currently live in Florida! What a coincedence! That must be a huge change!  __eou__ It is! Where in Florida? __eou__ I'm from Sebastian Florida, Right underneath Cocoa beach ! What part are you from ?  __eou__ For real? I'm in Palm Bay __eou__ Nice, I go to Palm Bay all the time to shop and hangout! 
my daughet made the volleyball team __eou__ That's great!  Congrats to her!  I bet she worked hard. __eou__ She really is talented and I'm proud of her effort. __eou__ That is awesome! Such a great sport for young ladies! __eou__ I know... I only did beauty pagents and that was not worth the time __eou__ I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form __eou__ True, though they need a mascot! __eou__ True, what types of foods you enjoy? __eou__ anything but pork.... i have always wished to have pet pot-bellied pig! lol __eou__ I agree, actually I only eat vegetarian foods! __eou__ And vegetarian is good for both my figure and the earth! __eou__ Very true! Do you enjoy listening to music? __eou__ Music is always on around here! __eou__ I like listening to classic rock most of the time. It's my favorite era of music.

I love the American Eagle, though! __eou__ Aeri was actualy a sub brand of American Eagle outfiters lingerie retailer . __eou__ Maybe I should get some for my girlfriend's birthday, though that might be too forward __eou__ How long have you been dating? Back in the day, it would be offensive. __eou__ Nearly two years....  __eou__ Yes, that is probably not an offensive gift then __eou__ I do love her and that store... maybe I'll take some money from my new-truck savings account... __eou__ What if she doesn't like it? __eou__ I'd best keep the receipt!  __eou__ Or play it off as a joke __eou__ At least she likes the chevy truck i want to buy __eou__ oh i drive an aston martin pickup truck
Yes, he's been getting speech therapy since he was 2. __eou__ Great, speech or voice therapy is used to improve or modify the human voice. I am sure with time he can overcome his mild alalia. __eou__ Hi! I am Mary. I have two children. My oldest son has autism. He is 7 years old and is the light of our life.  __eou__ Children really give us the opportunity to see they world in a new light. You are so blessed! __eou__ Indeed! It is a blessing to have a little human that loves unconditionally. It also gives our family the opportunity to grow by serving. __eou__ Yes, I can imagine. Family is one of the most important things in the world to me! Without them, I never would have survived my terrible motorcycle accident. __eou__ Wow! You too have your challenges! No one has a perfect life. Like my son, I'm sure you deal with physical and mental therapy to cope. __eou__ Yes, My whole left knee is filled with metal. I had to learn to walk all over again. Talk about humbling.. __eou__ I'm so sorry, but thankful you survived. We all do our best in life. Although my son is not "normal", he too humbles us daily. __eou__ Yes, Mary, me too! Having children with developmental disorders is so hard, and unfortunately not everyone is understanding. Blessing to you and your family. __eou__ Thankfully there are many services and therapies available to help him and us as supportive parents. The schools have also been very helpful in his progress. __eou__ That's amazing.  I'll bet that some of the educational treatment works for sure.  You are definitely a hero for doing this. __eou__ Awareness for autism and support for autistic adults is definitely growing. The people working for this are my heroes! __eou__ That is so true! I think social media has helped spread a lot of awareness about how widespread the disorder is. 
So I just moved to a new city and havent really made any friends here yet. Im really missing my friends and family back home. __eou__ Do you like your new city? __eou__ It's too early. I miss my old place. __eou__ It takes time to adapt to a new city. Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people. __eou__ I'll try. Maybe painting classes. My mom is a painter. __eou__ I always admire artists, that eye to hand thing is amazing!  What does she paint? __eou__ Nature!! She is not a Rembrand,but she is doing well/ __eou__ I love landscapes.  The fall oes especially with the bold reds and oranges.  __eou__ I love that also. I used to do walks with my best friend all the time.But she has moved and I moved,so it's hard. __eou__ It's hard enough keeping friends as an adult in the same city, but living in different places is worse.  Thank goodness for social media! __eou__ Yess!!!!! 30 years ago, you had to call people or write them,waiting for an answer letter a couple of days. __eou__ I was a teenager when the internet started to go mainstream.... now I have friends that I met online who come to see me.  __eou__ I know. I can call my kids in Holland and watch them also same time. Skype. __eou__ I remember when internet phone services came out and they were sooo crappy! But it was the only way I could call my bf at the time
My car stop working last week. I took it to the mechanic. It need a lot of money to fix it. __eou__ Oh no! Hopefully you're able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again. __eou__ I'll have to. I can't haul vegetables from my garden without it!  __eou__ I understand. Sometimes I fix also myself my car to save some money. __eou__ Doing it yourself is always good. I grow my own herbs and vegetables for that very same reason !  __eou__ I like to grow my own food as well..  Fresh is the best! __eou__ My favorite food is raw onion. So fresh is the only ioption!  __eou__ Raw onion is so good.  Raw garlic too if you can take the heat.  And raw garlic is an antibiotic.  Very good for you. __eou__ I enjoy growing all different kinds of herbs ! Garlic is a favorite of mine as well!  __eou__ Do you like chilis as well? I love all spicy food.  Chilis are easy to grow. __eou__ I love chilis! You can't make a good soup without them ! Do you enjoy bell peppers? There another favorite!  __eou__ I eat them every day.  That is how I get my vitamin C.   Great for soups or salsa but I usually eat them raw. __eou__ They're good raw as well, just like onions!  __eou__ Great minds think alike!
I miss my dad. This was his favorite time of the year __eou__ yea that can be hard when things remind you of people __eou__ It's hard when you're in college, especially when breaks/ holidays come.  __eou__ It is. I have never been on an airplane so it's difficult to see my family who now live in other states during this time of year. __eou__ Oh, you know planes are not that scary, you get used to it.  __eou__ I am trying to come around to it, hopefully someday it doesn't terrify me. __eou__ The thing about planes is they give you small food, and I usually have a starving appetite and eat big meals, because I'm active a lot. Lol. __eou__ That makes sense! especially longer trips! __eou__ I'm sorry you don't get to visit family much. I like to video chat with family I can't see often. __eou__ That's a great way to stay connected for sure! I should do that a little more often with my family! __eou__ You should, I use it even if I need help in college with homework or something else, it is so convenient. __eou__ I agree! I have been thinking of maybe starting a youtube chanel. __eou__ Oh cool! What would you're YouTube channel be about? __eou__ I am pretty big on duck hunting season. Maybe it can be based on that.
I love to drive as well, but not in big cities. I worry too much about wrecking! __eou__ Yes; I know exactly what you mean.  City driving can be quite scary.  The vast number of cars really didn't begin until the 20th century though.  In 1908, Henry Ford began the assembly line production which resulted in the mass production of the Model T.  Since then, cars have been everywhere, especially in large cities. __eou__ Yes.I was in Chicago last week for a funeral (my dad died) and it's horrible to drive there. __eou__ I'm so sorry for your loss.  Losing a parent is a hard thing to go through.  __eou__ Yes, but it was a peaceful end.He was 87 and died in his sleep. __eou__ we should all be so lucky... Mine was 45 when he died.   __eou__ OH.That's way to young. Terrible. __eou__ yes, unfortunately the generation above me hasn't been know for their longevity... :( __eou__ Well, lets talk about something else. What is your favorite color?Mine is yellow. __eou__ Teal. :)  Why do you like yellow somuch __eou__ I don't know. I just love it.Wht's yours? __eou__ I don't know, I've always liked the blue greens.  they're just so soothing.  __eou__ Blue greens?? what is that? __eou__ when you have colors that aren't quite blue, but aren't quite green.  so a color between.  Like red orange, or yellow green
I was mad when I got fired last year. I did nothing wrong __eou__ I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job? __eou__ Not yet... no new job yet __eou__ I hope you find one soon. For me I would take the oppurtunity to spend time with my begals Chance and Boomer. Work takes so much time from them. __eou__ I know... I like to paddleboard when I have time off, though now I'm bored of boarding! __eou__ Keeping busy is good maybe take up a new hobbby. For me my dogs and travling to visit my girlfriend in Salt Lake city takes my not work time. __eou__ Well, I do play my piano.... Maybe i could learn a new instrument or travel... but i really need to work __eou__ Music is so soothing. I get the need to work but if you have the means to travel do it! You can't take the money with you. __eou__ I know, I know... maybe I could find a remote job.. __eou__ That would be the ideal life work from anywhere. For me it would be a lounge chair on a beach. __eou__ For me, it'd be an at-camp office where i can paddle-board! __eou__ That sounds nice. We love camping and the dogs love hiking which makes my girlfriend happy she could walk all day. I'd rather relax at camp. __eou__ Me too... they can hike and I'll tend the fire - aka, relax! __eou__ Exactly - a nice day of chillaxing.
I love Rock music also. Do you know what influenced that genre? __eou__ has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and rhythm __eou__ I love cooking soul food __eou__ I do too! Collard Greens and black eye'd peas, with a bit of corn bread. Yes please! __eou__ I like making pizza with a cornbread crust! __eou__ Oh! I never would have thought to put those two together. You must be a very experimental cook! __eou__ yes, i love taking different cuisines and turning them into pizza. do you like pizza? __eou__ Yeah!! I think there must be something wrong with a person who doesn't like pizza! __eou__ I agree with you babe! __eou__ Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer. __eou__ I like beer and wine, myself __eou__ Have you ever had a Guiness beer float!? Those are so yummy. Ice cream and beer, who would have thought!? __eou__ no, where can i try it __eou__ Its something I like to make for my family (of age of course!!) You just add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a glass filled with Guiness beer.
that's great . i love nature but one time i started a fire in a forest __eou__ oh , that stinks . what is your favorite food ? __eou__ smores! __eou__ Smores are good. Love them around a campfire. I have long curly hair so I have to be careful though.  __eou__ I have long hair also, so i know the challenges __eou__ Yes it can be a torture. Do you buy your own clothes ? I sew mine to save money. Odd maybe but I'm frugal  __eou__ I'm not that talented! But I do try to repair/patch things as much as i can - part of why i always carry a knife __eou__ Carrying a knife is smart. Never know when you'll need it. Can even use it to cut the string while you sew! So many uses. __eou__ Some even have a flint to start fires.... :-/  :-( __eou__ That's true and when camping that can be useful!  __eou__ Well yes.  But you have to be careful - i learned the scary hard way __eou__ Safety should always come first. Whether while using a knife or sewing it is a requirement !  __eou__ Safety first... yet people forget that! __eou__ They do an bad things happen! Why when camping i always keep my long curly hair in a pony tail ! 
oh ? what kind of song and are you from africa ? __eou__ you know that song i saw the rain down from africaaaa __eou__ Toto.  Always one of my favorite songs in high school. __eou__ Yes, and I also enjoyed the band Toto, which had a few hit songs. __eou__ Yep they also did the song Rosanna.  My kids even like that song. __eou__ Great song, It was written by a band member who was dating Rosanna Archette at the time. __eou__ Yes.  I have heard that as well.  What other bands do you like? __eou__ I like classic rock bands like The Who, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and many more.  What bands do you like? __eou__ Pretty much everything from 50's music to now.  The Beatles, REM, Red Hot Chili Peppers,  Taylor Swift ,  Vance Joy.  I'm all over the pace.

I have been to every state except Alaska and that is still on my bucket list. __eou__ really why not alaska ? i helped start facebook by the way __eou__ Alaska seems so far away for some reason. Hoping you have benefitted financially from facebooks popularity! __eou__ I live in Texas so that it really close to me __eou__ Hmmm. I still think Alaska is far from Texas :) Maybe I'll take a cruise there some day. So are you still involved with facebook? __eou__ I LOVE RIDING __eou__ Lol! I have never ridden on a horse. I went to Texas once but never made it to a ranch. Would love to do that someday. __eou__ where are you from __eou__ Indiana __eou__ what is your native place
One more month and I get to go on a vacation to the beach! Its been 5 years so I'm chomping at the bit! Yay! __eou__ Excellent! Which beach? __eou__ Anna Maria Island!  It's so beautiful there.

What kinds of things do you like to read? __eou__ Novels mostly. I have been reading Dickens novels lately. __eou__ I have not read Dickens since school. I love history and am reading about the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. __eou__ The Sun also Rises.  Great Hemingway!  If I am remembering correctly  which I may not be. __eou__ It is Hemingway and yes you are remembering correctly :-) __eou__ That"s good.  Thanks for the acknowledgement.  I haven't read it in a long time. __eou__ The book talks about Hemingway reporting on the war and the crazy partying he did with othe reporters. __eou__ That's right.  it's all coming back to me.  Have you read Gore Vidals'  Lincoln?  Great history.
That is such a varied place, how big is the country? it must have everything there, so many different weather phenomenons __eou__ Only the capital, Reykjavik and surrounding areas are really populated. It seems like you'd have to visit there for all your traveling needs.  __eou__ Must be a beautiful place.

Always great to watch. They are so active
I wish my mother never left as a kid. __eou__ Why did she leave? __eou__ because i had dreams of flying airplanes  __eou__ Listened to too much Peter, Paul and Mary growing up?  __eou__ yes they were very popular in nevada] __eou__ cool.  Your mom worked in Vegas? __eou__ yeah she did, not sure where she went though __eou__ Did you ask the magicians?

I make salads and  smoothies __eou__ I have tried a vegan diet but I missed meat too much __eou__ I actually have gotten very used to no meat. I've found a lot of great substitutes that are nearly as satisfying. The health benefits outweigh the sacrifice. __eou__ I keep thinking about trying again as meat substitutes are much more tasty than they used to be __eou__ Go for it! I love dating women and finding unique places that serve what Im looking for while still giving her options. __eou__ Sounds amazing. I am just calorie counting at the moment. And doing more and more exercise __eou__ Focusing on fruits and veggies will help a lot with the calorie counting. Its a challenge at first but eating healthy meals at home is the best plan. __eou__ I will try that as I eat wayyyy too many carbs. And I enjoy cooking from scratch. __eou__ I substitute spaghetti squash for spaghetti and cauliflower rice for rice. That really cuts down on carbs if you love pasta like I do. __eou__ Oh pasta is a favourite of mine. Half of my meals are pasta based. I will look into those for sure.  __eou__ And its awesome that you like cooking from scratch. I cheat and use the Instant Pot for nearly every meal. __eou__ Oh don't get me wrong. When I'm busy with work, I cheat too. __eou__ Have you ever used an instant pot or electric pressure cooker? Its great! Especially as a vegan. Whole veggie meals take only a couple of minutes.

When was it first discovered? __eou__ Well it's a pretty popular fish.

That makes it hard to say when they were first discovered. __eou__ nice, what else do you know about them? __eou__ that's about it. what hobbies do you have? __eou__ I like studying science, weightlifting, hiking, guitar, gloving and making art.  what do you like? __eou__ besides fishing i like traveling, reading nonfiction, and hanging out with my dog. __eou__ I like traveling too.  what place do you want to visit more than anywhere? __eou__ Japan. I have been to Europe a lot but Japan seems so fascinating and like another planet, almost. __eou__ Me too!! I'm a huge nerd and I've always wanted to go to Japan.  That country was made for nerds!! __eou__ Yep I think so too. Plus I really want to ride the super cool high speed train with a view of Mt. Fuji. __eou__ Tokyo is so crowded that they have hotels with little slide-out cells for people to stay in with only enough room for the person and that's it __eou__ And there's that giant intersection in Tokyo where during rush hour as many as 3000 people are crossing at one time. Crazy! __eou__ it's nothing compared to a city that was once in China.  It's been destroyed, but it had 30,000 people in 5 acres __eou__ Wow! How long ago was it destroyed? __eou__ no idea, but you can probably look it up
What the hurricane did the Caribbean last year made me sad. __eou__ It was a very devastating storm. __eou__ What happened to those poor people puts my problems in perspective. __eou__ It makes me realize how lucky we really are. I donated to the red cross but still wish I did more. __eou__ I donated also! I would have given more if I had gotten the promotion I deserved. I have 10 years experience but another woman got the job. __eou__ At least you were considered for a promotion. I've been stuck in my position for awhile now. __eou__ True! Just wish I knew why I was passed by. I believe its because she is prettier, peppier and younger. __eou__ If that's the case, you should talk to HR. You could file a suit or get a raise if true. __eou__ Hmmm that's food for thought. I am also struggling in my relationship. My boyfriend of 3 years has asked for an "open" relationship! __eou__ That's a deal breaker right there. Break up with him! __eou__  I do think you are right on this one. I just need the confidence to move on - to a new job and a new man! __eou__ It's tough to make a change like that but it'll be long worth it in the coming weeks. __eou__ Right. Especially when I consider the hurricane victims. I need to make the best of every circumstance. Staying with him is NOT the BEST. __eou__ Maybe take some time off of everything and move to help the victims. Something that helps not only you but others as well.
I always wonder if people actually ate the wedding cake __eou__ Well traditionally they were made to bring good luck to all those who attended the wedding, so I assume you were supposed to eat it originally. __eou__ I mean i will always eat cake when i get the chance __eou__ not all weddings are the same . what kind of cake ? __eou__ can't go wrong with a chocolate cake __eou__ especially white chocolate... so fattening, but it's the best!! I think so anyways __eou__ yes I could eat white chocolate all day __eou__ chocolate lava cakes, yum!! __eou__ do you like cheesecake? __eou__ I do, I get a different kind every time I go to Cheesecake Factory.  The reese's one is my fav __eou__ that sounds so good I've never actually tried it __eou__ they have like at least 50 different kinds, including a smores one and a carrot cake cheesecake __eou__ the carrot cake one sounds nice __eou__ I also like cheesecake icecream

What is your dog’s name? __eou__ Hey, I could probably learn that way too. My dog's name is Lionel. He is a part scottish terrier and part mutt. do you have a pet?
I was sad when I didnt earn the promotion. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that, maybe you'll get the next one! __eou__ thank you I appreciate the support! __eou__ You should listen to some music. I always listen to the chainsmokers to cheer up.  __eou__ I enjoy the chainsmokers, I saw them live in concert this year __eou__ That's awesome! I've been trying to see them but work always gets in the way. __eou__ I would highly recommend it if you ever have an opportunity. They are really fun live! __eou__ I'll have to see them this winter. I don't work as much when it's cold outside. __eou__ Do you have more time off in the winter? __eou__ Yeah. I work as a lifeguard at a lake so the winter is usually time off.  __eou__ Yes that makes perfect sense. How do you like being a life guard? __eou__ It's a pretty good gig. Just wish it payed a little better. __eou__ Well at least you enjoy it __eou__ Yeah. What do you do?

They should make him a game character __eou__ that's true i bet he does, how could you not play video games __eou__ I don't know.  I'm always fidgeting with my hands so it helps me __eou__ video games are the best! __eou__ better than the rest!
Oh I know, it's huge over here! __eou__ It ranks among the most popular out of all high school sports in the US and Canada __eou__ I enjoy watching my son play, he is a wide-receiver on the team __eou__ It's not so popular here in the UK but the game is getting more support year to year. __eou__ True, it's not as popular as soccer. Although the NFL has a few games over there every year to try and grow its popularity __eou__ Yes I go watch them every year. I'm going to watch my favourite team, the Jags tomorrow as it happens, in London. __eou__  Oh they are a fun team to watch __eou__ Oh indeed they are. Up one minute, down the next. And college football over there. It's crazy popular __eou__ Yeah I like watching the Iowa State Cyclones - that's my favorite college team. __eou__ I plan to visit the US next year but unfortunately it will be out of season for football. I'd love to watch a college game live __eou__ Where will you be visiting? __eou__ Texas, just before the crazy heat of summer starts __eou__ Oh very fun you will enjoy it __eou__ I think so too.

Huge paintings would have to be my favourite. __eou__ very abstract paintings are what i love __eou__ Same here! I can admire them all day long.  __eou__ same, its quite cool __eou__ I painted a beautiful waterfall with a wide variety of rocks in the background one time. __eou__ wow i wish i was able to paint. would be amazing __eou__ Never too late to learn! the key is to be patient and try to be in a state of 'flow'. __eou__ i think i may consider looking into starting. the amount of equiptment you need also puts me off __eou__ That can always be a barrier. I had to invest quite a pretty penny to keep up the habit. No regrets! __eou__ Its a good habit to get into.
Man I went to the bar last weekend __eou__ What happened there? __eou__ I got wasted __eou__ How was that? __eou__ it was a lot of fun __eou__ awesome - Those nights are the best __eou__ i don't remember a lot of it __eou__ you must have drank alot __eou__ yeah a bit too much, i nearly got kicked out __eou__ oh no i bet you got in trouble ! ! ! __eou__ yeah, I won't be drinking that much agin __eou__ I have never been an alcoholic, but I never drank that much __eou__ its fun to drink now and then __eou__ True that!

A man followed me as I was walking home last night. I walked really fast to avoid him catching up with me. __eou__ That is really scary.

I don't know how rare it is but in the 14 years I've been married we've seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity. __eou__ Yeah. Infidelity is a huge problem in this city. __eou__ i hear some horrible stories that people do to their partners. it's awful __eou__ My older brother's wife cheated on him. It was heartbreaking. __eou__ your poor brother. it's better to know in the end but the process of finding out is horific __eou__ Oh believe me it was. He opened Facebook and found she was seeing other guys. __eou__ wow. people use technology and forget it's a paper trail of the deception __eou__ Oh yeah. She thought she was smart but she wasn't. __eou__ clearly. well she is out of the picture now __eou__ You could say that. That's for sure... __eou__ has he been able to move on? __eou__ Yeah but he's still upset about it. He goes punch dancing in the woods to calm down. __eou__ i would just be at the gym 7 days a week to let off steam
I got the news that my girlfriend's mom passed away. I have to tell her the news myself since she has no other close family. I'm dreading having to actually say it to her. __eou__ first of all my condolences for your friend, and i know how hard this is for you both __eou__ Yeah. It's been really difficult. She's heartbroken. She's been depressed and sleeping alot. __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . i'm also struggling here watching my parents in their last moments . __eou__ Losing a parent is never easy. Especially at a young age. Her mom was the only family she has left. __eou__ Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone you're close to. __eou__ Yeah. Her and her mom use to love going to farmer's markets. Now they won't be able to again. __eou__ Oh that is so sad! They ought to inspect their animals better before selling them. __eou__ Yeah. Perhaps they should inspect their animals better. __eou__ do you have any hobbies? __eou__ Yeah. Walking my dog, going to farmers markets and hanging out with my hetro-life partner Silent Bob in front of the QuickStop. __eou__ that's a good combination . hope everything goes well for you . __eou__ Thanks. Hopefully the girlfriend will heal in time. In the mean time me and Silent Bob are heading back to LA. __eou__ I love California.
Yeah, it annoys my partner as well. I suppose it's worse than snoring to him. __eou__ I heard that it can run in families. do your parents sleep talk at all? __eou__ not that I know of.  Apparently I laugh in my sleep. haha __eou__ That is pretty funny, to be honest. __eou__ I must have some hilarious dreams.  I do have some really weird ones __eou__ Like bad dreams or what? __eou__ no, just straight up alice in wonderland weird __eou__ ooh thtat sounds almost creepy __eou__ it can be, most of the time entertaining though __eou__ lol i think snoring is why i do not have a girlfriend right now __eou__ yeah, snoring really annoys me.  They make devices that stop it though __eou__ Ah okay, that is good then, I hope they are effective for you! __eou__ I'v never used one!! just know about them __eou__ they can be quite expensive
so , do you have a favorite color ? mine is yellow . __eou__ yes , mine is pink ? my favorite animal is a koala what is your ? __eou__ I like meerkats. Cute but vicious. Who is your favourite author? __eou__ My favorite author is Anne Rice! __eou__ Good choice. I like the horror genre. Richard Laymon is my favourite. __eou__ I can't do anything scary. Live alone so it would creep me out all night. __eou__ I live alone but I'm the opposite, I love anything scary. Ghosts don't bother me. The living hurt you more. __eou__ Can't say I disagree with that. I'll stick to my beloved Anne Rice. I have a blow-up doll dressed like her. Too much? __eou__ Maybe but I've just lost a mouthful of coffee through laughing so much. __eou__ I hope nothing got on any electronics. Would have had a koala of a time with that! __eou__ Haha. No the laptop is safe, it went all down myself. I'll use that though when I next start to write a novel. __eou__ I will be buying that novel. I work part time so have been writing a little myself. __eou__ Well I hope it all goes well. You have a creative mind!! __eou__ Likewise, we must let our thoughts roam after all.
I love Taylor Swift, I would love to go to a concert of hers __eou__ I try to go to her concerts as well. She is known for writing about her personal life and incorporating them into her songs. __eou__ she also writes alot of her songs about her ex-boyfriends __eou__ I like older music like classic rock and funk the best __eou__ do you like the eagles band? __eou__ yes, but Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin are some of my favorites!! __eou__ I love Zeppelin __eou__ definitely very unique vocals __eou__ and fantastic instrumentals __eou__ A song by the Who called boris the spider in 1966 had the very first heavy metal death growl __eou__ I will have to check that out __eou__ the video that goes with it is really cute too __eou__ oh really? Ill check that out __eou__ I like the Beatles too
No, it was personal.  I was with my family.  We were flying to Europe.  This was before 9/11. __eou__ That's great!  How did you like it?  Apparently New York has the busiest airport system in the US. __eou__ That's crazy, right?  __eou__ Right? You would think! It also boasts the largest city airport system by passenger traffic. Its really amazing!! __eou__ but nothing is same like it was before 9/11 __eou__ Exactly, 9/11 changed everything. TSA made air travel worse. It's annoying really. __eou__ but there is nothing we can do about it, we just have to get used it, right?  __eou__ That's the sad truth. It's been 18 years and I still haven't gotten use to it. I'm barely old enough to remember life before, but it seemed better. __eou__ it's insane... time flies fast __eou__ Yes it does. It seems like only Yesterday, Jeter was still playing, Seinfeld was still on the air and Alice in Chains were a new band. __eou__ anyway, I recently a saw really cool video on youtube how to make ginger cookies.  __eou__ Ginger cookies sound good. They are prefect for the Holiday season. __eou__ after that I couldn't stop watching make up videos because I will look fat after holidays __eou__ Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but as a guy I like a girl in make up. Girls always look good wearing it.
that's a good question . but i do like beer and creeks . __eou__ do you drink them at the creeks __eou__ Nowhere but. It helps let nature sink in. Done that before? __eou__ Back in the day! What else do you like to do for fun. __eou__ Eating Lasagna. I can't eat it because of the cheese but why eat lasagna without cheese? __eou__ The whole point of lasagna is the cheese. I guess you can't eat pizza either? __eou__ Nope. Does it stop me? Nope. __eou__ Ha. Have you tried vegan cheese? __eou__ I have. It does'nt have the terrible effects of real cheese though so I stay away. __eou__ I have tried it before too but it doesn't melt very well so why bother? what do you enjoy eating that doesn't have cheese? __eou__ The melting quality is what makes cheese if you ask me. I usually have skittles every couple hours. How about you? __eou__ actually I never eat candy or much sugar. it makes me feel terrible. __eou__ Same here it really takes a toll on the diabetis. Have you tried vegan brownies? __eou__ I have tried them. They're actually not bad. 
I've always heard of them but don't know much about them. __eou__ they are so gross - they feed on skin flakes from people and pets, and sometimes mold.  __eou__ when people make their bed it creates a better breeding ground for mites, so it's actually better to not make your bed __eou__ we should really do something with that, I am allergic to dust! __eou__ that sounds really unpleasant!! __eou__ but the worst part is you have to clean every day and keep the flat tidy all the time.  __eou__ yikes!! there's worse allergies than that though.  I've heard of being allergic to water __eou__ allergic to water? so you have to drink vodka instead?  __eou__ I have no idea, as far as I know it's not a deadly allergy.  Just constant mild symptoms __eou__ that must be why i did not know ! __eou__ what if someone was allergic to  themselves? __eou__ well, what if I am allergic to myself? __eou__ I don't know.  Dust contains dead skin cells so you're constantly surrounded by yourself __eou__ by dead parts of me. 
How can i not be  made at her when my wife wasted all my retirement money __eou__ She spend all  youre retirement money? That's pretty messed up.  Why did she do that? __eou__ She's very bipolar. Sometimes she goes on these crazy spending binges. __eou__ Bipolar must be difficult. Not knowing which person you are going to get. __eou__ Yeah. I love her, but it's not always easy. Sometimes she's super creative and loves writing. Others shes really depressed and that usually leads to shopping binges. __eou__ Is she on medication for her condition? __eou__ She is. Sometimes she forgets to take it though. Other times I'm not sure if it works. She does see a Therapist though. __eou__ Maybe it's time to convince her to try a different medication, perhaps? Or meditation? __eou__ She does meditate from time to time. However, she has a hard time sticking with it. __eou__ Is there some sort of positive reinforcement you could try? Maybe a gift card to spend as she likes when she has not 'binged' for a specified length of time? __eou__ I  do from time to time. I bring her flowers and try to get her out of the house __eou__ Is there a better way to control your funds so she can't shop you out of house and home? __eou__ I hate to do this because she is my wife.

My dog died 5 minutes ago. I am so distraught. __eou__ That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life. __eou__ She loved to go for walks. I went on many hikes with her that I wouldn't have done by myself. __eou__ I bet she was so happy doing that with you. It sounds like she had a good life and was well loved. __eou__ I live by the ocean and she loved the beach too. And belly rubs!

Our dog always wanted to play with him. The cat would play...for about thirty seconds. Then he had enough. __eou__ Aw, poor doggie! They always look so sad when someone won't play with them. I hope they were friends otherwise. __eou__ They were. The cat just liked to mess with the dog! You know how cats are, always want to be in control. __eou__ They always ARE in control. Of the humans, too! ;)

Hello.  __eou__ Do you like take-out? Its a concept found in many ancient cultures. __eou__ I didn't know it was going in all ancient cultures but yeah I do. __eou__ I am surprised that take out was a concept found in ancient cultures.

I tried violin but it wasn't for me.  __eou__ How come, do you not like that style of music? I would love to learn how to play the harp. __eou__ Violin is great really. I think I just liked the larger stringed instruments. Less painful to learn.
I didn't feel great one time when I showed up at court drunk. I was ashamed of myself __eou__ Oh really, what was the judge's reaction to that __eou__ He said that I should be ashamed of myself and I really was. __eou__ i think i am lucky that i dont like to drink. __eou__ Well I am into fitness and I hate that I drink because I could be so much ctronger. __eou__ yeah thats true , but i think i am addicted to paint  __eou__ Well I hope you are not eating the paint or anything? __eou__ hahhahaha  , i mean i like to paint lol __eou__ Well that is a great addiction to have. Make sure you font get addicted to anything else. __eou__ yeah thank you , what do you like to do? __eou__ I love to do yoga and pilates its the only thing that keeps me focused. __eou__ good to know you are  a fitness freak __eou__ Yes I am I think it is not only beneficial for the body but the mind as well. __eou__ really, do you think you can become more intelligent?

Mostly weight lifting though. __eou__ Nice. I originally did weights for my training but I want to incorporate more cardio. __eou__ Yeah I'm trying to get more into running. Get a little more leaner. __eou__ I might set a goal to run a half-marathon. Just to prove people wrong, you know? People say that because I'm a short woman I can't do it. __eou__ Haha. Idk if height has anything to do with it. But giving your all is what counts.
I hoped today that I would get a charge reversed from a company that charged me early for a free trial __eou__ did it work out or still waiting to hear back? __eou__ It worked out! I just had to call and speak to customer service. __eou__ That's good! I recently had a bad run-in with customer service.
I had my test for a new certification at work.  I really wasn't that nervous for it though. __eou__ You must have prepared well in advance to not be nervous! __eou__ I studied nonstop it seemed, but now that's over It really feels good. __eou__ Awesome! When will you know the results? __eou__ Monday afternoon at the latest I was told, what have you been up too? __eou__ Just hitting the clubs and enjoying what's left of the nice weather! __eou__ G __eou__ What are you going to do now that the test is over? Feel like going out? __eou__ Was going to ask if you'd like to do something, I was thinking we could get outside, maybe do some hiking since the weather's still nice. __eou__ I'll be busy through the day for the next few weeks -- but I'm free every evening this week except for Tuesday __eou__ That sounds even better, maybe go clubbing? what time Tuesday do you want to meet up? __eou__ I can't Tuesday. Any evening but that one. How about Thursday? They're having a party at Stix __eou__ OK, then Thursday it is. I'll meet you at Stix. __eou__ What time? Want to go eat at Fogo's before? __eou__ say around 8pm? and Fogo's is good, seems like forever since I've been there.
Me too, I wish I could afford to have more done, but learning the methods is fun too sometimes! __eou__ I wanted to be an interior designer, at least be the one who researches and coordinates the new designs __eou__ I found the sets on Game of Thrones so convincing. Ever thought about stage design? __eou__ I really thought about being a interior designer do you think that is an easy field to get in __eou__ I have no idea what it would take. I think you would find competition stiff in a large city, for sure. __eou__ I think being blonde in this field would be a plus well i sure do hope so __eou__ Heh, heh. Beautiful hair and all is what we seek with our interior designers! __eou__ I know right just saying would make life great as long as the boss stay in his lane and dont try coming on to me __eou__ You could always commit to working with women bosses, although even this might prove a challenge these days. __eou__ you right women are so disrespectful to each other i just dont feel like an all women job would be in my best intrest __eou__ I love working with women and interior design will surely place you alongside women, even in school. __eou__ Well if you think it would be a good fit I'm all in __eou__ The best thing I know about the field is being able to use your creative mind, but yep, you will have to work with women all right. __eou__ Ok being blonde and being in a field with women may not be as bad as i think Im gain
The sun is shining here - it's going to be a good day __eou__ That's a great attitude to have. __eou__ Thank you! When the sun is out it is easy to have a good day! The other day I just curled up in a ball cuz of rain. __eou__ Aw man. You don't like the rain?? __eou__ It was too cold! And then it got humid and penetrated my being. Usually I love it. __eou__ Ohhh. Yea I know what you mean.. I love to watch movies on a rainy day. Hbu? __eou__ I like to read on rainy days. I really like thunderstorms best. These I can't sit still for! I just watch for lightning. __eou__ What kind of books you read?

Them romance novels will keep you warm ha. I usually play games. I don't watch TV much. __eou__ Computer games, I take it? What kind? __eou__ Ha, yeah definitely. A game called Quake. I play it constantly. You play any games? __eou__ Too addictive! I get stuck on bubble-shooter as it is. heh heh. My son liked Eve. Ever play that? __eou__ No. I'm pretty focused on Quake. Me and my friends even have a group to help us strategize. Haha. __eou__ That is how he played. He became an administrator for the game. That good. 
I really hate public speaking, so it doesn't help that I had to recite a poem in public way back in like 6th grade. __eou__ I definitely understand that feeling.  It took me forever to sign up for my Speech Communications class because of speaking in public. __eou__ I definitely  don't have a career in politics! Did the Speech Communications class help? __eou__ it did . what did you study or do for work ? __eou__ I'm in medical school. Hoping to be a surgeon someday __eou__ What field of medicine are you studying? __eou__ Cardiothoracic Surgery -- heart, lungs, that sort of thing. __eou__ i like going to school but i don't have steady hands so no surgery for me . __eou__ Both of my parents are doctors. I grew up playing the game "Operation" if you've ever played that -- I was a champ! __eou__ Yes, but my parents were both clowns so it was really crazy when we got together to play games. __eou__ LOL! We need to introduce them! It wouldn't hurt my parents to lighten up a little bit! __eou__ They would make me take the train with them to work. People would look at us strange! __eou__ Hee hee hee... no wonder you were leery of public speaking! __eou__ I am afraid of clowns now. Still taking the train to work. Do you take the train?
Getting ready to make the toughest decision of my life tomorrow. Have to turn myself in for a hit and run that I did 2 days ago. Guilt has been eating me up __eou__ Why did you lie? __eou__ Habits maybe, I'm not truly sure myself. What should I have done? __eou__ why what did you do ? __eou__ I was drunk and I was scared... __eou__ That is no excuse! You know how much I love my hot dogs. You took it and Lied about it. __eou__ I'm not talking about the hot-dog situation... I left them there. They were laying on the ground. I don't know if they were okay.  __eou__ Just come clean I know you did it. It is like a scene from my favorite horror novel.  __eou__ I don't know if I'm ready to accept the consequences. It is not my first offense. I know it's my fault, but I'm so stressed out. __eou__ Don't stress. I forgive you, but you need to buy me some more.  __eou__ Why? You're suppose to support me without wanting anything in return.  __eou__ You lie about taking my hot dog and you expect me to support you. This really is like my horror novel __eou__ Can't you move on? This is serious. My job is on the line. I didn't went to law school all these years for nothing.  __eou__ I do not even know what to say to you right now. 
i love to surf when the tide is calm . __eou__ our boat is docked on the pacific right now . __eou__ Nice! How's the weather? __eou__ Looks great for fishing off the boat, but I am stuck cutting hair. __eou__ What a job! I hope you get plenty of time off. I haven't been very busy, just reading a lot. __eou__ I don't have time to read or fish. I never get to use the boat except for sleeping at night. __eou__ Wow. I know how to cut hair. Maybe I can take your place for a while and give you a break! The Pacific sounds nice right now __eou__ That would be great. Maybe I could learn to serf too.  __eou__ I'm not a certified surf instructor, but you could use my board while I'm cutting hair LOL __eou__ I will surf when the tide is low. __eou__ Yes, start slowly. Do some internet research when you get a chance! __eou__ Thanks! I plan to. __eou__ What's the best way to get there? __eou__ You should google it.
Wow, that seems really long __eou__ 2,200 mils is the estimated length of the trail __eou__ Yeah that's one of the reasons its a favorite trail of mines.  __eou__ same, its quite cool __eou__ I often use stock photos of it for some of the marketing campaigns I work on. I plan too visit very soon. Have you ever been? __eou__ Yes I have been. Me and my brother have red hair and people on the trail look at us strange. __eou__ Hahaha. Do you look back at them strange? People with red hair are awesome! They're just jealous that's all. __eou__ That makes me think of the janet jackson song I get lonely lol. They seme ok. __eou__ People like that make me want to scream. Like thar Michael and Janet Jackson song. Lol.  __eou__ I used to listen to George Michael and Atomic Kittens lol I was a teen when that song came out __eou__ George Michael is the guy who sings Careless Whisper right? __eou__ I always imagined taking over the world with him. just a crazy thought.   __eou__ Here's a thought: Appalachian Trail with a man and woman and the guy has bad breath and talks to her and the Careless Whisper sax plays.. Perfect mint gum commercial! __eou__ that sound amazing! Me and my brother look like twins! Maybe it could be a double mint gum commercial?
well you can trust me __eou__ i'm wary of trying anything new __eou__ I'm the same way, but honestly, hiking in the mountains is a lot of fun. __eou__ I didn't mean that. I just meant trying that new backpack as being untrustworthy compared to my old one. __eou__ I don't like change, either. Maybe you could try the new backpack out, and keep your old one just in case. __eou__ OK. You know, I would never get rid of my old one. How about you try the new one instead? __eou__ I could do that. I have a hiking trip planned for next weekend.  __eou__ Super. Super. Where are you going? __eou__ To my vacation home in Pine Mountain Valley. It's near Fort Benning in Georgia. It's great hiking there! __eou__ Hmmm. I haven't been hiking in Georgia yet. My last hike was near Monte Cristo in Washington State. Whew! __eou__ Was it a long hike, or just a lot of altitude? I've never been to Washington State, but it looks beautiful in pictures. __eou__ Altitude, for sure. The hike is at least 7 miles. Yeah, it is beautiful. I would like to hike in Georgia sometime. __eou__ It's nice. Pine Mountain Valley is at the foothills of the Smokey Mountains. I can hike the Appalachian trail from there. __eou__ Nothing like Western Washington Cascades, I bet?
i do not blame you , i sell jewelry at country craft shows __eou__ oh that sounds cool ! what else do you enjoy doing ? __eou__ I study the Bible a lot __eou__ So do I. I live in the big city, but I love getting out of town to go on a hike and read. __eou__ Oh, me too! Every chance I get. I love nature. __eou__ I would love to move to a cabin in the woods and leave the city behind. __eou__ It sounds nice. I wouldn't mind having a cabin for retreats, but I like being pretty close to civilization __eou__ I would be fine on an off the grid homestead. I have had enough civilization to last a lifetime.  __eou__ I get like that sometimes. I'm pretty big on creature comforts, though. Plus I have to sell jewelry to pay the bills __eou__ What kind of jewelry do you make? __eou__ Necklaces, bracelets, that sort of thing. I love using Swarovsk crystals __eou__ Crystals are really pretty.  __eou__ I do like shiny things LOL. Does your work keep you pretty busy? __eou__ Absolutely!

Celebrating 3 years of not smoking. __eou__ Good for you! I smoked for years and quit. The only thing I smoke now is meats on the grill. I hear there is great food down under. __eou__ That's great!

I would probably enjoy them too if I could ever put down my Harry Potter books. __eou__ Oh my god, I love Harry Potter too! Who is your favorite character? __eou__ My favorite is Hagrid. I can relate to his connection to nature and animals.  __eou__ You must love Fantastic Beasts as well then? __eou__ I do, however, I like the setting of Hogwarts better.  __eou__ I can understand that, there's just this ambiance in Hogwarts that is impossible to replicate.  __eou__ Absolutely. Who is your favorite character? __eou__ Hermione for sure, so witty and passionate! __eou__ I like her too.  __eou__ I don't think anybody can dislike the golden trio haha

Turbo was great. __eou__ That's so cool. I love being on the wild side sometimes too, that's why I love swimming. Gives me a boost of energy every time __eou__ Me too! I once swimmed in a lightning storm and felt the electricity through me. I got out then. __eou__  I had the same feeling when I had some tacos from Eddy's Locos Tacos the other day, as you can see i love tacos __eou__ Well, I am a pizza fan. Love the fresh tomatoes on Canadian bacon. Love it so much.  __eou__ Do you agree with pineapple on pizza? if you do we could honestly be best friends __eou__ Consider it done. I always order Hawaiian pizza on at least half of it. Wow. __eou__ Oh wow haha that's actually kinda same. Doesn't even have to be ham sometimes I do pineapple and pepperoni  __eou__ Ever substituted fried salami instead of bacon with the eggs? __eou__ Never BUT now that you say that it sounds like a great idea. What brand? __eou__ Well, make sure it is thin sliced is all. Most brands have this incredible shelf life. Like two year from now. __eou__ Oh well I'll look forward to buying some then. Maybe my local Publix has em, thanks for the tip! __eou__ Sure! __eou__ Nice talking have a great nice! __eou__ You too!
I'm so happy I found a new job! We've been struggling financially for a couple of months and i'm so thankful for my wife who was super supportive __eou__ Congrats! I bet that makes you feel great! __eou__ Yes! Not gonna lie though, it's a bit stressful. Especially the fact we had to move.  __eou__ I can imagine it can be stressful, but all that is behind you now. __eou__ You're right! It's time for celebration, which funny enough is the name of my new town haha! How's your job going? __eou__ It is going alright I guess. I love what I do, but it can be very stressful. __eou__ Understandable! What do you do when you're stressed out? __eou__ I love to spend time in nature. __eou__ Oh cool. Do you just relax or like go on hikes? __eou__ Both. I am a hunter so I spend a lot of time in nature. My family does not eat any store bought meat.  __eou__ Can you hunt all year round when you are?  __eou__ There is almost always something in season, but most is in the fall or winter. I usually am able to keep our freezers full throughout the year. __eou__ That's really cool! I wish I could do the same, but I can't get myself to push the trigger in front of an animal.  __eou__ Hunting is something passed down in my family. We are Cherokee and only hunt with traditional methods.  __eou__ I find it's honorable to continue traditions like that. 
I always try to be ready for things when I travel. __eou__ Me too. I plan like 10 years ahead of time. How far in advance do you plan?  __eou__ Wow! Ten years is a long time to be prepared. I plan 3 years ahead. __eou__ The Internet has made it a lot easier! I used to be a travel agent a long time ago, though. Lots of places I still need to see! __eou__ Yes, the Internet helps me research my travel and career options. Do your old job? __eou__ It's much easier now. I'm always planning trips in my mind -- I'm planning every trip I'm going to take for the next five years __eou__ I am too forgetful. You must have a great memory. Do you miss your old travel agent job? __eou__ Sometimes. It was fun planning trips for other people, and gave me good ideas about where I'd like to go. What destination do you dream about going to? __eou__ I really want to go to Novalja, Croatia. Next year, in 2020, they are hosting the Fresh Island rap festival. __eou__ How awesome! My father's family is from Croatia and I've always wantd to go there. That sounds amazing! __eou__ Really? That is awesome! I hope you do get to go. Do you still have family in Croatia? __eou__ Yes, I only know them through Facebook, though. And I love Croatian rap! Fun to watch YouTube videos LOL __eou__ That is really cool. I try to stay in touch with my family through Facebook. They are all in the UK. __eou__ That's one thing Facebook is good for. I've found family on several continents that I would have never known about otherwise. Do you miss the UK? __eou__ I wish I did miss the UK. I left it when I was 3. I hardly remember it. I want to visit it.
i wish it was in hunting , i love to eat loads of meat __eou__ what do you like to hunt __eou__ Deer, mainly, The bigger the better. And you? __eou__ mostly deer that is the most popular in my area __eou__ Deer are everywhere where the're nature. I take it you live close to a forest? __eou__ Yes! My boss works for the forest service.  __eou__ Hmm, I guess that means you also work for the forest service, yeah? I'll bet it's a rewarding job, being so close to nature. __eou__ my girlfriend! She is my boss too lol __eou__ Yeah, the best women are our bosses. So, you're studying at university, yeah? What are you studying? __eou__ Im in school now for psychology. ITs so boring! I would rather sing __eou__ Singing is fun, and can be quite cathartic. You should do a study to see how singing affects mood. __eou__ Definitely working on that.  Good idea! Do you go to school? __eou__ No. I'm too busy hunting deer and fishing. __eou__ Did you ever think of taking classes maybe or watching videos? Of deer?
I usually order a Ribeye, which has some bone. I like it marinated in Terriyaki, or a Garlic butter compote. So good! __eou__ Well is the word steak is used without a qualification it is just a beefsteak. __eou__ It is all steak the name is determined from what part of the cow it comes from. __eou__ I guess it make sense, yes. I like to eat my steak medium rare. How do you like yours cooked? __eou__ I like medium well to well. __eou__ Some people would say that you like them overcooked haha!  __eou__ I have had many people tell me that. I just can't bring myself to eat it any less done.  __eou__ I can understand, no judgment here! My mom used to cook them well done because she was afraid of food poisoning.   __eou__ I am not sure of why. I eat duck medium. __eou__ Duck steak? So you agree that steak can be mean more than just cow meat?  __eou__ It can be. I have deer steak in the freezer, but the duck is duck breast.  __eou__ Did you hunt the deer on your own or just store bought __eou__ I hunt them. My family does not buy meat from a store.  __eou__ That's pretty cool. You must save money then. 
I'm working so hard to see if I make the police academy. __eou__ wow that's so motivating to hear, what inspires you to become a police officer __eou__ I've always been interested in criminal justice. My mother was a victim of violent crime once, and I've always wanted to be in law enforcement. __eou__ Sorry to hear about your mother. Good for you! Better job than mine working at Target __eou__ Target's a great store. I'm glad I've got one so close to home. How long have you worked there? __eou__ Just started 3 days ago! I get a discount on dog biscuits. I buy my dog one after work every day. But i have a secret!  __eou__ Oh yeah? What's that? You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine __eou__ The dog treats! I cant help __eou__ LOL! Some of them do look tempting. My secret: I'm afraid of the dark. I hope they don't figure that out at the police academy! __eou__ hahahahah. We have that in common!  __eou__ I'll have to give the dog treat thing a try! __eou__ I can only eat them in the dark! lol __eou__ LOLOL! That's the funniest thing I've heard all day! I'll have to tell my mom that one. She's really my best friend __eou__ My dog is not quite my best friend, but she sure does cheer me up a ton!
i really like 16 candles and pretty woman are a couple of my favorites __eou__ do your kids have favorites ? are you tired of hearing them sing disney tunes ? __eou__ I don't have kids, unfortunately - boating accident. __eou__ So sorry to hear. They are laying in green pastures sure... __eou__ That's sad. So have you seen 16 candles? __eou__ I have seen every single one! All sad. All green! I think green is my favorite color. What is yours? __eou__ Grey is probably my favourite colour, but I like blue. What's you're favourite one? __eou__ Blue is nice. What kind of music do you like? __eou__ I like rock and rap mainly, though I enjoy a bit of synth pop music as well. Prefer films though. What about you? __eou__ ROCK! I like rock and roll. BINGO
we sound like my favorite type of music country ! can you play a guitar ? i can . __eou__ i can ! i also play the banjo . i make a fire and pick all night . __eou__ I'd love to be able to play banjo, but I can only play the guitar __eou__ It's basically the same, just have to memorize new chords, and practice finger picking.  __eou__ Yeah, the only problem is that banjos cost a fortune. Are you in a band? __eou__ Oh I get you, they definitely are expensive instruments. I was in a band before yes! __eou__ I'd have loved to be in a band, but life takes over. I'm more into fitness and running these days, you? __eou__ Interest and passions seems to change with time. That's amazing that you're into fitness. Music is my favorite hobby.  __eou__ Yeah. Who's your absolute favourite? __eou__ It is hard to pick one. My favorite artist right now is K flay. Do you know her? __eou__ No but I think I'll Google her for a listen. I'm quite fond of female vocalists. Do you recommend any others? __eou__ I'm glad. Oh the list could go on forever. Florence and the machine, Haim, Courage my love, Sainte. __eou__ I wish I still enjoyed music like I used to. I don't find the same joy from it that I once did. __eou__ That's difficult to deal with sometimes I find, when we lose interest. Do you used to go to concerts?
I prefer Heavy Metal, Punk or Celtic Alt. Have you heard of the Rock band the Tossers or the Bollox? AMAZING! __eou__ Lyrics often stress loves, but also can be social or political __eou__ It takes a true poet to write that down __eou__ Some thoughts you just have to capture before they're gone, right?   __eou__ i agree completely.   __eou__ Do you like rock music? Metallica, ACDC, or Nirvana?  __eou__ I live in Seattle and have seen most of those groups live! I was born a giant  __eou__ Awh man! That's incredible, who among those you saw was your favorite? __eou__ Nirvana! Good thing I am tall! My parents were over 6 ft. i could see over the other peoples heads. Do you like them? __eou__ I think they are great. They are in strong rotation on my playlist. I'm a cab driver, so my customers get to know good music. RIP Cobain __eou__ cab driver? i hope that you are not driving now lol. i am a angry democrat,you/? __eou__ Shh, don't tell! Is angry democrat your profession or hobby? I just plain and simple don't trust the govt. __eou__ Its all a conspiracy my friend. Listen to the late ones. The truth is hidden in never mind.   __eou__ The late ones? The truth is hidden? Where?! I NEED to know.
in the winter . i do a lot of hiking but more in the summer months . __eou__ i'd love to hike and find a nice height to read a good book . __eou__ Who is your favourite author? __eou__ My favourite author is Robin Hobb. She writes epic fantasy with wonderful characters. What about you? __eou__ Dan Parkinson has some excellent novels.  I really like the Dragonlance series.   __eou__ I've heard of that series but haven't read it. What did you like about it? __eou__ I like that it takes place in a world with endless possibilities, the author makes you feel like you're there! __eou__ That's the main draw with fantasy for me. The sheer scope makes anything possible, and with a good writer, you're immersed.  __eou__ Do you read anything by George RR Martin? __eou__ Yeah, I've read his Song of Ice and Fire. He's probably my second or third favourite author. I take it you're also a fan? __eou__ I am definitely!  And the t.v. adaptation was great... until the way the writers ended it.  What did you think? __eou__ I think the two creators are terrible writers and I have no idea how they managed to blag their way through the first 5 seasons. __eou__ I enjoyed most of the series, but the way they wrapped it up so fast was a disservice to the story. __eou__ Yeah.

My son recently was jumping on the couch and broke it. __eou__ Wow! Did you punish him or anything? __eou__ I put him in time out to let him think about what he did. __eou__ You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline. __eou__ Maybe it was all the sugar, but he couldn't stay still for the duration of his punishment. __eou__ How did your son get so much sugar in his system?  __eou__ I think it must be from all the sugary drinks he got from the neighbor kid's house. __eou__ Maybe you should ban him from having any sugary drinks as punishment.

It does make me wonder. __eou__ Yeah, you should probably look into that more. She sounds shady. __eou__ So are you suggesting that I should come right out and ask her?

I need a man in my life who wants to be as intimate as I. __eou__ I think the supply of gentlemen these days are dwindling.  __eou__ Sadly, that's true.

I work all day long and my teenager have been home all summer. __eou__ is it gonna feel better , when they finally start going back to school ? __eou__ I guess so. That way I can get more things done in the day. Do you have a teenager? __eou__ Yes and sometimes it can be so difficult! __eou__ I agree. My teenager has not once asked me if I needed any help with household chores. Does your teenager help you out around the house? __eou__ Well, only with prodding. I've had to negotiate a lot to get them to do much of anything, but it's gotten better this last year. __eou__ That's good to hear. Maybe your teenager can encourage mine to help out, haha! Do you drive your teenager to school? __eou__ My teen just got his license this summer, so we let him drive the old Ford to give him some experience and independence. __eou__ Oh I see. That's nice. Mine hasn't got her license yet so I still drive her to school in my Prius. __eou__ He just seems to forget to change the radio station back to my country music.

Didn't the same thing happen last month? __eou__ It happens a lot, but my dog sleeps downstairs or in my sister's room mostly __eou__ Your dog must be lonely, maybe he just wants to sleep upstairs. __eou__ He's old, he just wants to sleep, doesn't matter where haha __eou__ Oh no! That could be the worst. What is your favorite activity to do with him? __eou__ Well, when he's awake we go play frisbee, but his old legs don't carry him far now so mainly we just chill - he likes horror movies! __eou__ i love horror movies . i love to be afraid ! __eou__ Same here!! I love the adrenalin.  What's your favourite? __eou__ I like the 2000 horror satire called 
Tomorrow's an exciting day for my family. We're sending our two youngest children to a new school! __eou__ Oh nice! Tell me about the new school? __eou__ It's a catholic primary school, it's the best school in the area. Are your kids still in school? __eou__ yes both my children are in school but they do not go to a private school __eou__ How wonderful, have you been to any national parks recently? __eou__ No I do not have a lot of time. I spend most of my time working at a museum __eou__ I enjoy history museums, do you take your kids to work? __eou__ sometimes when they have take your kids to work day lol.  __eou__ That's interesting, I like my job. __eou__ Well it is important to like your job. I do not have a lot of people to hang out with so it's mainly my kids. __eou__ Kids can be fun too, they have their interested which can be interesting for me too. __eou__ Yeah my children are quite the characters __eou__ Pure innocence is quite a special thing. __eou__ It really is. I do worry about keeping them safe though that's my number one priority
The other day I was going through my things and I found my old Gamecube. I remember all the fun times I had playing with friends. __eou__ Did it make you nostalgic? __eou__ SUPER nostalgic.  Basic as it sounds, I miss playing supermario etc with my friends __eou__ I love Super Mario. __eou__ Same here! I'm super anxious, so playing newer mario games with my kids really throws me back __eou__ I heard there were over 500 million Mario video games sold.  I guess we werent the only ones that like it. __eou__ Really?  That's crazy!  That's like finding out that lego sells 75 billion Lego bricks each year
wow that is quite interesting __eou__ why are you going to paris ? do they even serve french fries there ? __eou__ The last time I was there I didn't have time to finish the Louvre Museum, and yes I do believe I ordered french fries last time. __eou__ oh ok i have never herd of the louvre museum __eou__ Wow really. that is the museum that houses the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo.

My family will usually watch him but they live in Oklahoma.  __eou__ What type of dog do you have? __eou__ I have a chocolate lab. __eou__ oh wow cool ! but im afraid of dogs but i love to see them  __eou__ He is very gentle. __eou__ oh ok
I am afraid the Russians are going to take over the USA. __eou__ Really? why? __eou__ Because of all the Russian collusion in the elections... It's scary how much happens that we don't know about __eou__ I am more interested in the collusion with Ukraine. __eou__ I haven't heard about that one? __eou__ I love following politics but sometimes it is hard to know what to believe.  __eou__ Or who to believe... It's just a massive game of he-said-she-said __eou__ It really feels like we are apart of a fake world with all the fake news. __eou__ What's your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ I try to avoid conspiracy theories. __eou__ As a writer, I love them.  They can be so mind blowing.  Why do you avoid them? __eou__ Many of them are manufactured to harm the other side and do not follow facts. __eou__ How so? __eou__ With Trumps Russian collusion the investigation report has come out saying no collusion, but people still believe it. 
i wonder how miami u is holding up i am an alumni there __eou__ oh ? its nice except i wish the m was blue instead of red . love blue ! __eou__ Well I guess we have to take the colors the way they are given us. __eou__ That's true we have to take the colors that are given to us lol __eou__ Miami is so expensive now.  I make close to a million dollars a year but I don't kow if I'll be able to send my 3 kids there. __eou__ Yeah it's ridiculous how much it is to live in Miami. Do you ever wonder if you have any royalty in your family? __eou__ It is insane how expensive.  Not really. I already know I am a royal pain.  :-) __eou__ Lol my mom always joked with me and said that I am related to the Queen of England and I am next in line for the throne.  __eou__ Must have been waiting for the facilities.  Many people in your family? __eou__ I have a lot of family so we have to be thrifty on spending.   __eou__ Yeah that can be tough when things are tight.  I am so lucky I have a great job. __eou__ Well right now I am more of stay at home mom but, my husband is the head of Taco bell so we survive __eou__ It is great you can be with your kids all the time.

Every time I try to eat dinner, a salesman calls me on the phone. __eou__ That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore. __eou__ They're not but that doesn't mean they don't. __eou__ Exactly, especially where a call would be impolite or inappropriate, like calling very late at night. __eou__ They always interrupt family time. I do not answer the phone any more if i don't recognize the number. __eou__ That's very fair, thank god for caller ID. Should be ending soon and you can go back to your normal life without those pesky calls. __eou__ I hope so. __eou__ Unknown calls make me anxious. __eou__ Same Here. I am glad my phone now tells me if a call is potential spam. __eou__ Exactly!  It's a shame email spam filters aren't as advanced. __eou__ I agree. I think I have 100 spam emails to every 1 legitimate email. __eou__ Even automatic spam applications don't do the job right. __eou__ I think they are getting better.  __eou__ They are, but so are spammers... It should be prohibited honestly, they're mainly scams

Get back to humanity's roots of eating meat and veg an exercising, instead of like... McDonalds __eou__ True lol. I try to eat healthy but I also include meat as well. My small beagle named Droopy likes to snitch my food. __eou__ Meat is really good for you, to be fair!

I have just heard about the new episodes from Reddit. __eou__ Oh, good things or bad things? Haha __eou__ For South Park I would say bad, the Band in China literally got them banned in China. The episodes themselves seem pretty good. __eou__ I mean, it sounds like the goal was to get banned in china... besides, it isn't hard LOL __eou__ I think it was an unintentional goal. __eou__ Even winnie the pooh and dr who are banned in china haha
My sister in law should have never had children.  Yet she was able to get pregnant right away. __eou__ Never had children as in infertile or a bad person? __eou__ She's not a bad person. She's just incredibly irresponsible. __eou__ That is not the greatest for the kids.  Hopefully they will be ok.
yeah that's cool , what is your favorite color ? __eou__ pink of course and yours ? __eou__ Green, it's so natural and woody __eou__ Green is a great color!

i cant wait to go on my trip next week __eou__ Oh yea? when is the trip? __eou__ Next week.  I like summer better but I got vacation in fall so there it is. __eou__ I enjoy going into the mountains and looking at the leaves in the fall __eou__ Yes, that is the best thing about autumn.  When the leaves change. __eou__ I also enjoy camping in the mountains its so cool __eou__ I love camping almost anywhere unless there is a lot of bugs.   __eou__ well, bugs are part of the experience.  They are not so bad in the cooler weather __eou__ That is true.  In the summer bugs are terrible except for all the butterflies.  They are awesome. __eou__ yes, but where I live it gets very hot in the summer so camping then is not so nice.  I camping better in the fall or spring __eou__ Camping in spring here is cool and wet.  Not the best. __eou__ I've camped in the rain before too.  not fun!  but its the experience that counts __eou__ :-)  Yep, camping in the rain is definitely an experience you will not forget. __eou__ do you camp in parks or in other paid campgrounds? __eou__ Parks as much as possible.  They are more scenic.
Companies that make huge profits should give back to the ones making them that money __eou__ I agree.  The social relationship between the workers and the employers should be based on hard work by the workers, and fairness by the employers.  It boosts morale of all workers to see that both employees and employers are on the same team for each one's benefit.  __eou__ Plus, wouldn't you agree that when you benefit from working hard, it's easier to get motivated to do so? __eou__ That is so true. I feel the same way. It's nice a nice feeling to really earn your money. __eou__  It's like my fiancé and his allowance from his dad. The more he does around the house, the bigger the allowance he gets. __eou__ I'm surprised that your fiance still gets an allowance from his dad, I presume he's of working age? __eou__ He is. But he lives with his parents still. We're looking foward to leaving Kentucky together, I'd like to go live in Seattle. __eou__ Why do you want to go and live in Seattle? __eou__ Many reasons, but mostly because of the fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage. That city values a fair worker compensation. __eou__ Right ok, that's pretty good. What do you do for a living?
I am kind of irritated right now. My brother feel asleep on the couch where the tv is __eou__ That's interesting I have a tv by my couch as well. You have good taste. __eou__ It makes it easier to watch. What are your favorite movies?  __eou__ i like all kinds of movies to watch with my family __eou__ I like horror and romance the most. A little bit of evil and light lol. Some people say that I am a hopeless romantic because of it.  __eou__ horror movies are a good way to take your mind of of things. the Halloween movies were fantastic. Nice and frightening __eou__ Yep I guess it really makes you think about life and how things can really be.  __eou__ It makes you appreciate the quality of life we all are afforded. __eou__ Yes it does I guess sometimes I wear my heart on my sleeve because I have been naive in the past __eou__ sometimes being naive is a comfortable way of living. Knowing too much can make you bitter __eou__ Yeah that's really true __eou__ everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane! or at least try to stay sane. haha __eou__ Lol that makes a whole lot of sense __eou__ it's all depends on ones attitude
Ok what  makes them great?  __eou__ creeds just a solid and consistent rock band and makes good songs __eou__ You're not wrong. I wish I could make time to plan a trip to see them perform. __eou__ Where are they playing next? I heard the tickets cost a fortune. __eou__ I'm not sure. When I lived in Chicago, I think it was at least a hundred per seat. Must be more now.  __eou__ Yeah, no doubt. Still, it must be worth it. Do you like any other similar bands? __eou__ I must admit I'm a fan of the classics, The Doors, Nirvana... if I wasn't so busy with my law degree I'd go to concerts more often.
oh no . why are you upset ? __eou__ the neighbor attracts mice with their garbage . and he has cats ! __eou__ Hmm, then perhaps you should get a cat too? I have one in my tiny house, it keeps critters away! __eou__ I can't. I'm allergic, and even if I wasn't I don't like cats. Or any dirty animals. Should we call pest control? __eou__ Have you seen any mice indoors? If not then baited traps should do the trick __eou__ No, not indoors yet. I'll try. I don't know how you can stay so calm? I'm about ready to get in my car and leave. __eou__ I suppose it's the serious, responsible lawyer-to-be in me that stays calm in any situation. Plus, they're not inside! __eou__ Yet! Haha. You're right, I'm getting overly worried due to my phobias, but it's just so hard to stay calm. I might go and work on my car to relax __eou__ How has it been going with that car? You seem to have been working on it for months! __eou__ Yeah. The truth be told I don't think I'll ever finish. It drives the wife mad but a man needs his space. What do you do to relax?
My dad had a stroke about a month ago and we've been waiting to see if he would recover 100%. __eou__ im sorry thats awful, i hope he makes a full recovery __eou__ He is my hero, I have always looked up to him __eou__ Yeah, My dad always my hero.

I have two daughters as well.  One just turned 18 and the other is 15.  We've homeschooled them both. __eou__ That's awesome! I homeschooled both my daughters as well. I loved the less formal way of educating! __eou__ Yes, I think it is a much healthier environment for them. I care a lot for my children's health. I pay special attention to what they eat as well __eou__ I loved all the science experiments although many ended in failure! lol It's sad that homeschooling is illegal in many countries. __eou__ Yes, many science experiments can still be done at home. We use to do some really fun ones when they were younger __eou__ Unfortunately that is all I enjoy about homeschool. My dad teaches me __eou__ so you were homeschooled as well? __eou__ Yes. I often found it boring as my dad would be very harsh on me __eou__ oh, I don't think my daughters find it too boring. Besides, they have a lot of other activities and sports that they are involved in __eou__ Wow!!! I wish I had a similar experience to your daughters __eou__ yeah, they are quite lucky as well. We have quite a lot of land, so they had wide open spaces to play on growing up __eou__ Well I grew up in a small house, so there was not much room for fun __eou__ Oh, I did as well! And i hated it. That's why I made sure my daughters would have a different experience __eou__ You are a great parent

it was suprising to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger for a free t-shirt __eou__ That is a lot of meat. __eou__ Do you like fast food? I have a george foreman grill and can cook a burger better than most fast food joints __eou__ I love fast food.

I feel mad when I hear about my friend's situation with his 2 daughters.  He's a single dad who works 10 hour shifts 6 days a week and the ex-wife collects the child support cash to pamper her new boyfriend  __eou__ That is pretty bad situation he is in. I feel little mad myself too. __eou__ He only has one day to spend with his daughters.  Not enough time at all __eou__ That is terrible. Maybe he needs some help to resolve the situation in court. __eou__ I try to help him when I can by watching the girls, but living in a condo does provide much enterainment. __eou__ Maybe taking them to the park or reading to them will give them some comfort.
I've driven through part of it. I didn't get spend any real time there. Is it nice? __eou__ It is very pretty, its considered the blue grass state. __eou__ Oh, I think I would enjoy traveling around the states more.

Arizona is different to any place I have ever been.  __eou__ Do you have a favorite place you have visited? Mine would be Dublin, Ireland. The view from the Guinness sky bar is amazing  __eou__ Oh wow you seem to be quite the traveler! My favorite place would be Stockholm, Sweden.

One thing I love to do while traveling is to draw the landscape scenes. I am no proper artist, but it is a fun hobby __eou__ I bet they look amazing.

What other types of museums exist? __eou__ Well, there are different types of public museums that shows exhibits such as art or history __eou__ Do you have any suggestions of a good art museum? __eou__ i love museums , so maybe somewhere with them __eou__  I read a lot of history related books also, so I would love to go see a history museum. __eou__ I love museums as well, they really help teach the public about different things we may not otherwise know __eou__ I agree. At the science museum I visited they had many interactive things to learn and experiment with. That was a lot of fun! __eou__ O awesome, so its more of a general public museums and not one of the niche ones more meant for researchers? __eou__ Well, it wasn't the Smithsonian if that is what you mean.  __eou__ Do you like museums? I have a lot of friends,that go to museums __eou__ Yes, I love museums. I work at one that is a science museum. __eou__ O wow, is it more of a local museum or one of the larger ones they have in major cities? __eou__ It is a larger museum in a major city.  __eou__ i love dogs and cats,seeing the art of animals is inspirational.i love the city
i am sorry to hear that . i am working on a lab right now . __eou__ i'd love stuff like that , my dad is trying to force me to be a journalist . __eou__ oh really? is that something that interest you? __eou__ Not really.  I"d rather do research in a lab. __eou__ i get that, labs can get interesting.  but my passion is gymnastics __eou__ Rhythmic gymnastics is interesting because many people manipulate pieces like ropes or hoops. I could see why the rhythmic aspect makes it seem like a dance. __eou__ Being tall helps with different routines, and i have to be in shape to do it, so it is a lot of work __eou__ True, you need good upper and lower body strength, as well as muscular endurance. I think it would be difficult. __eou__ yes because of this i have been considered well built but im afraid my passion wont pay the bills so thats why im in labs __eou__ understandably , probably mostly brain power is needed . __eou__ yes does take a lot of consentration and smarts __eou__ I'm sure it takes patience too. __eou__ of course.  but it can be rewarding with the final product __eou__ Very true.  It must be a proud moment for you when you achieve the final product.

I didn't know it was ending though? __eou__ they have 44 seasons,star was a tv series in it only had 3 seasons,in that ended __eou__ I did not know it was ending, sorry to hear that! __eou__ shows tend to get good at the end  __eou__ Yes they do and then they leave you hanging and wanting more! __eou__ absolutely!!! iMy mom and dad are both a red head,when i watch tv series most people have red hair in some dont __eou__ It is always comforting to see others who are similar to us on television. __eou__ yes Im six feet tall,in when my family watches tv they sit behind me __eou__ That must make it a little difficult for them to see the tv then, unless they are even taller than you are? __eou__ my dad is 6,9 my mom is 5,5 __eou__ Well, it sounds like your height landed nicely right in between their heights then. 
i'd travel the world and see the sites if i could . other countries have amazing views __eou__ traveling and seeing our wonderful mother earth is why i got into teaching . __eou__ What a great profession! I've always wanted to teach. I love to read, so English would probably be my preferred study __eou__ I enjoy teaching others, you would be surprised at how much there is to know about nature and the environment.  __eou__ I can only imagine! What do you teach? __eou__ In my latest travels I have been teaching about aviculture being necessary due to the effects on various bird species. You should read my blog! __eou__ SOunds interesting! __eou__ You could travel and teach English ESL! I hear it is a fun and lucrative job. __eou__ That would be a dream! I have small children, so it will have to stay a dream. Do you have children? __eou__ No not yet but I would still do what I do. My mother was a teacher as well and we had many great adventures. __eou__ Good for you! That's great that you had that experience with your Mother. My Mom just moved 3 states away. She's living her dream on the beach now :) __eou__ How wonderful! One thing I learned is...A trip across 3 states is just as exciting and beautiful as across the ocean. You should visit your mom. :) __eou__ That's wonderful advice. Thank you for that! __eou__ it is always good to take time to visit or go on vacation with your family. I wish I could! Take care!
I'm moving out of state with my boyfriend in a month or so for a new start! I am very optimistic about it! __eou__ That sounds interesting. How far are you moving? __eou__ Hello, how are you today? __eou__ I am doing all right! Are you going to be moving very far? __eou__ Not very far, about an hour away.  __eou__ Oh that's not too far at all. Moving can be quite stressful, but it you find yourself a good spot it is so worth it
So many to pick from, but i definitely love any of the new steel coasters.  The wooden ones are too rough. __eou__ I know.  the wooden ones are a bit more classical, but they don't have inversions, or steep drops.  Even the banks are often shallow in comparison to the steel roller coasters.  Do you have a favorite theme park you like to attend? __eou__ I have been to Six Flags in Georgia, what about you? __eou__ I have been to Six Flags in Gurnee, IL and near St. Louis, MO. However, I much prefer Universal Studios Orlando over both. __eou__ Really, I would love to go to Universal Studios. I bet it was really fun. __eou__ It is amazing, especially if you love thrill rides. Sea World also has some great coasters. I also LOVE Disney World! __eou__ Wow, sounds amazing. I have got to set a goal and go to d __eou__ You totally should. You are NEVER too old to enjoy Disney!

Watch it on YouTube if you've never seen it. Also, Rock N Roller Coaster. __eou__ Thank you, I will. Sounds exciting. I think I would love the Rock N Roller Coaster. These rides give you a real thrill and excitment.  __eou__ Yes, it is in the dark, indoors and goes upside down and has inversions. It is a launch coaster. So much fun! __eou__ Great, thank you for the advice. I will definitely check these out.  __eou__ No problem! Hope you are able to go and have a great time! __eou__ I need some fun time, too much going on around here to enjoy myself.  __eou__ I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes we all need to take a break and get away for a bit. It's good for the soul. __eou__ I hear you. So good to talk to you, you have made my day! __eou__ You as well. Have a great afternoon! :)

I am pretty happy with my life right now, it is going pretty well overall __eou__ That's great when life just feels right __eou__ I know right, everything is falling into place finally after all that has happened. __eou__ What happened before? __eou__ Well all that trauma of losing a loved one, has a big impact on life. __eou__ That's sad, how long ago was it? __eou__ It's been a pretty long time, about 10 years, i remember it like it was yesterday.  __eou__ Yes, and you're happier now.  With life going the way you want it to go. __eou__ Exactly! How about your life at the moment?  __eou__ It seems to be looking up for me as well!  I couldn't be happier! __eou__ What has happened lately?  __eou__ I got a new job and things are going more smoothly.  How about you? __eou__ Oh wonderful, what job is it? I got a new pet. __eou__ Secretary.  What kind of pet?
This job is everything I could possible ask for. __eou__ Oh, what job is it? __eou__ It is a director post at the top fashion magazine in the States. __eou__ That sounds like a great job. Is it what you've wanted your whole life? __eou__ Yes, i get to look at people and their outfits and make a judgement call __eou__ Do you make judgement calls on your own outfits before going out with them? __eou__ No way, since I do not eat pizza, I do whatever works for me __eou__ How can you not eat pizza? It's the best! But maybe not as good as chocolate milk. __eou__ I agree, but look at Tom Brady. In his new book, he said he doesn't eat cheese! How can this be __eou__ Maybe he is lactose intolerant. __eou__ baha I like chocomilk too, but the parameters of my character do not. I randomly thought of the song, Mr. president by Cocojumbo, its wild __eou__ I have never heard of that artist. What genre do they fit in? __eou__ I would say, reggae and dance music. Its definitely from the 90s or early 2000s __eou__ Would you compare the reggae portion to Bob Marley?
i  was chatting with my dad and the call dropped on us __eou__ Did you call him right back? __eou__ I tried but it went straight to voicemail... __eou__ Maybe lost the network... __eou__ That's what I am thinking, he is in an area that is prone to do that. __eou__ Were you able to eventually get a hold of him? __eou__ I left a message, I'm waiting for him to call me back when he gets service again. __eou__ Is the signal just bad where he's at? Or is it just a bad carrier? __eou__ It's the signal...It doesn't matter what carrier you have, calls get dropped all the time.  __eou__ Well, hopefully you hear back soon. Did it drop right away or after a while? __eou__ I was able to talk to him a few minutes before the drop...the wind must of changed direction. lol __eou__ Yeah, lol, doesn't seem to take much sometimes. __eou__ I was trying to see if I could get some kind of a signal booster for his house. __eou__ Might be a good idea if they don't cost too much and aren't too hard to install
I know almost nothing about fishing, actually. But I am willing to learn ! __eou__ That's awesome actually. I love the challenge of marlin fishing because the four marlin species are rare, large, and powerful __eou__ So you like to deep sea fish? __eou__ I haven't ever been deep sea fishing, but i'm it's on my to do list. __eou__ Do you like to fish at a lake or river? __eou__ Mainly on a river, i seem to catch more! __eou__ I like to fish but I don't like to put worms on the line or take the fish off the hook. __eou__ That's a main part of fishing though! I prefer flies or meat. __eou__ I"ll just use fishing lures.  and my husband can take the fish off the hook! __eou__ Wow, i didn't know they existed, that would help a lot. __eou__ Sure, they come in many sizes and colors and such.  Easy peasy __eou__ I once cut my hand real bad with a fishing hook, this lure would prevent this.  __eou__ Ouch.  I've never hurt myself fishing.  Do you fish often? __eou__ Mainly on a weekend when i have free time, do you? 
i actually prefer to travel and have been overseas a lot . __eou__ that sounds like more fun ! __eou__ Yeah for sure! I just got back from Souda Bay, Greece last week. __eou__ My identical sibling lives in Greece! I have been so busy baking cakes, that I baked my passport into the second layer __eou__ Lol! Do you travel as well? My mother is a well known celebrity so we are always jumping from place to place. __eou__ As a kid yes! It's in my blood to travel, I have been to 17 countries, and I love it. where have you been? __eou__ Wow thats a lot of places! I'm actually working on doing some short films for school and just got done traveling with my mom in southeast Asia. __eou__ wow thats neat! what are the films about? I would love to go back to SE asia and eat the oodles of noodles lol __eou__ Most of them have been documentaries about the fishing villages off the coastlines and how they live day to day. The noodles are to die for down there lol!
wow , you have come a long way ! __eou__ yep i want to move to california __eou__ Why California __eou__ I love the Monterey area.  I love the sunshine and the water.   __eou__ I thought the same thing but hardly ever get a chance to enjoy the beach. __eou__ Were you busy working? __eou__ Yes. Between that and family obligations it doesn't leave a lot of time for sun and fun. __eou__ I hear that!  That's why I'd like to move to California.  I feel like I'd be on vacation every day __eou__ Do you have to work or are you retiring? __eou__ I'd have to work but I would still feel like I was on vacation __eou__ At first I did too but now it seems like everyone is on vacation BUT me! __eou__ I lived in Galveston, TX and worked and it felt like I was on vacation every day __eou__ That's good. I hope you enjoy it. When do you plan on moving out there? __eou__ maybe next year.  I have to save up some money first.
I took a stroll down memory lane with my best childhood friend last night. __eou__ I bet that was fun! __eou__ Oh, it was.

Do you get together with old friends a lot? __eou__ Recently, I have gotten together with a number of all friends. I recently went to a reunion for my high school basketball coach __eou__ How fun! Did you play basketball much in high school?  __eou__ Yes. I loved to play.  I was a gym rat who played every chance I got.  Do you enjoy playing sports? __eou__ I'm a little too out of shape for sports now, unfortunately! I do often take my kids on outdoors walks, though. Is walking a sport? lmao  __eou__ Getting outdoors and getting exercise is what counts.  Race walking is a sport. __eou__ I suppose you're right. :) Race walking--I've never heard of that. Maybe I should look into it! __eou__ Race walking is actually an Olympic sport.  I think they walk long distances in the competitions. __eou__ I guess that makes sense. It sounds like it's more about endurance than speed. That's fantastic. __eou__ Yes it is.  Although they walk very fast.  It is a little comical to watch as their hips really get a workout.
I'm really scared of going down to my basement.  __eou__ lol why? __eou__ Nobody is home and I heard a loud shriek from down there... __eou__ do you think it was a ghost? __eou__ I can only hope it was a stray cat that got trapped __eou__ Maybe you should go check.  ease your mind a bit __eou__ Definitely not! I'll just wait until my step dad gets home from work! __eou__ Do you still hear the shrieks?  __eou__ No, its been quiet for awhile now. I've been distracting myself by studying some lines for a upcoming show I have with my theater group __eou__ yes, take your mind off of it.  What's the name of the show? __eou__ "Locally Grown" Its about a all girl gang in San Francisco  __eou__ Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out! __eou__ If you're ever in the Nashville area you should! That's where my theater group works out of. __eou__ i should ! that sounds wonderful ! thank you for the offer !
really i am scheduled to get one next week __eou__ hope it is better i've a big college exam on friday . __eou__ I am pretty anxious about my exam. I still have to study a lot. __eou__ Tests are stressful. I like to study in the library. __eou__ Yes, I do too. That way I am not distracted so much. And it is nice and quiet in the library. __eou__ Sometimes I like being alone so the library is perfect. __eou__ Yes. I agree with you there. I like to go for a walk around the block to sometimes by myself. Just to clear my head. __eou__ That seems like a nice way to relax __eou__ It is. Especially if it is nice weather outside. __eou__ Do you have nice weather right now? __eou__ Yes, it is about 68 degrees and sunny right now. __eou__ Where do you live? __eou__ I live in Florida. How about you? Where do you live? __eou__ I'm not from Florida, but I'm here for college. Are you in school?
Hi, I slipped on my wedding day whilst walking on the aisle. __eou__ Were you okay __eou__ yes I was __eou__ i see.  and now? __eou__ Now, I look back and it just makes me embarrassed!  __eou__ so, what was it that you slipped on? __eou__ I slipped on the white lace runner. My heel got caught on it. __eou__ wow, that must have been embarassing ... __eou__ Oh, it was! __eou__ i can only imagine - like walking out of the bathroom with toilet paper on your shoe! __eou__ I haven't had that happen thankfully! Anyways how is your day __eou__ it's ok.  mom is feeling bad so we may have to take her to the hospital again __eou__ No... I hope she feels better soon. I will keep her in my prayers __eou__ yeah, thanks.  hopefully it's something that passes or for which actual science can do something __eou__ What exactly is going on with her?
Sorry I have a cat who likes to jump on keyboards! I was going to say my mom actually teaches it. __eou__ Cool, it originated during the renaissance __eou__ hu __eou__ Oh no! It looks like kitty struck again. Maybe your cat wants to dance ballet too! __eou__ Yes, my cat and I love ballet __eou__ I wonder if they teach cat ballet at the Royal Ballet School? Haha! __eou__ Maybe, I'll have to look into it. Lol __eou__ So do you dance ballet yourself? Or do you just watch it? __eou__ I love to watch. It's a very delicate sport and thats what i love about it. __eou__ Absolutely! There's a dancer I saw on Facebook recently who is obese, and she's challenging traditional views of dancers. I love her. :) __eou__ Very nice, what is this dancers name __eou__ I think her name is Lizzy Howell. She's 15, and she's been dancing for 10 years. I think it takes a lot of bravery! __eou__ It's amazing how young they can start dancing __eou__ Gosh, it is. I started really young too. I'm so glad my parents let me do it.
Kale is a great green veggie! I just love it __eou__ It sure is. Kale plants have green or purple leaves. The central leaves don't form a head like cabbage. __eou__ I prefer the green leaves. How about you? __eou__ purple, here.  just a color thing, i guess __eou__ Ha! It might be. Green is my favorite color, so you might be on to something. I love to make smoothies with kale in the morning. __eou__ don't know about smoothies but "greens" are good for you __eou__ Yes, they are. I have an autoimmune disease, so I try to eat as clean as possible. I don't know if it helps, but I like to think it does. __eou__ oh, sorry to hear that.  what's your problem, if you don't mind my asking? __eou__ I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and a few other health issues. I do just about everything I can to keep from having flares.  __eou__ ah.  i get that, or some of it - osteoarthritic, here; pain and a bad health care system ... (sigh) __eou__ Yes, then you understand. I am sorry that you have pain also. Don't get me started on our health care system. Yikes! __eou__ yep.  if you don't have the money don't be thinking you're going to get the help you need.  it's unfortunate, really. __eou__ I agree. We have insurance, but we still pay over $10,000 out of pocket every year. It is quite depressing. __eou__ glad you've got some insurance.  if i had the money i'd go to the street to get what i need, that's how bad it is __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that. I will say some extra prayers for you.

How many do you have? __eou__ Same here, my daughter just turned 5 last month. Thankfully she hasn't mentioned wanting sibling yet. __eou__ Oh, that is good. I have 1 sister and I feel sorry for my daughter sometimes.

Chicken and beer is even better. __eou__ ah, yes.  i like the fried chicken.  not sure beer's a good "after breakfast but before lunch", tho, but ... __eou__ Haha, well it is because it's not as strong as wine or anything else.

I prefer to get my enjoyment through reading. __eou__ what do you read? __eou__ I love reading on the topic of environmental change. Especially on how it affects animals. __eou__ ah.  there will be big, *bad*, changes for all of us animals if we don't do something soon ... __eou__ Indeed. I just think it is horrible for the wildlife that has been affected by our actions. __eou__ yes?  the insectidae are dropping, too - great big ecosystem, nothing will be unaffected, i think __eou__ Do you partake in political discussions in relation to climate change?

Do they sell sneakers?  __eou__ Not that I know of __eou__ Hmm. Well, did you at least call the police? __eou__ Nah it seemed like it was more work than it was worth.

Their smushed little faces are so cute. Not good for their breathing though. __eou__ what?  why is it not good for breathing? __eou__ Since their snout is smushed up into their face, it makes it more difficult to breathe and fight off colds.  __eou__ oh ok __eou__ And they are more prone to heat strokes that way as well. Cute breed but a lot of work to keep healthy.

I love listening to the oldies. __eou__ yes, excellent music from the "standard" line-up.  i'm "listening" to more ambient these days, quotes on the 'listening' __eou__ I listen to a lot of rock and metal but I'm venturing off into dance and pop. It's good to diversify your playlist. __eou__ i agree with you there.  finding new stuff is a great eye-opener.  that's how i found soundgarden et alii years ago __eou__ I love Soundgarden! Tragic about Chris Cornell though. He was a great singer, I saw his band in concert before his passing. __eou__ wow, you got lucky.  and, yeah, i couldn't believe it when i heard it.  such a talent.  but people are people. __eou__ I couldn't either, such a great musician. What is your favorite genre? __eou__ i'm pretty eclectic in my tastes, it just needs to be well done.  who are you listening to currently? __eou__ Same. Recently I am listening to Jinjer. They are a Nu Metal band.How about you?
are you an animal lover ? __eou__ they seem to like me . maybe i should have been a vet __eou__ Which is your favorite animal ? __eou__ I love all animals, but cats are my favorite. What about you? __eou__ I love dogs. I personally  want to own one but they are experience. __eou__ They definitely are, but it is worth it! __eou__ Do you own a cat? __eou__ Yes, I have one. Do you have any? __eou__ No not at the moment. Is the cat a girl or boy? __eou__ She is a girl. I have had her since high school. I am now a graduate student in college. __eou__ Aw, what is her name ? __eou__ I call her Kitty.  __eou__ Clever haha! Did you get to bring her to college with you? __eou__ Only in between classes?
I just can't see myself adhering to that kind of diet for longer than a week., __eou__ yea but Vegetarianism  is adopted for various reasons so. __eou__ What are some of the benefits? __eou__ Health benefits for one, like a diet rich in nutrients __eou__ I have read some on it, but I like my protein from my steaks __eou__ I understand that, but there are a number of health issues linked with red meat consumption. __eou__ Very true, sometimes I think it is a no win situation, watch your cholesterol, watch your sugar intake  __eou__ Yes. I try to have a nice intake of fruit smoothies. They are filling, usually healthy and delicious. __eou__ Those sound good. I'm just not much of a cook and don't know how to do some of that stuff __eou__ Its not hard at all! Just get your favorite fruits, a small cup of plain or flavored yogurt, ice and a blender and you're good to go! __eou__ That's all there is to it ? I could handle that, it sounds easy! Thanks for the info  __eou__ No problem! Its really great because there are so many different flavor profiles and fruits to play around with. __eou__ Sounds amazing! I may have stumbled upon something new and healthy.  Hmm...maybe I need to rethink my red meat consumption?? __eou__ The thing is, you can still enjoy the red meat, just eat it, as with all things, in moderation. Maybe a steak every other week or so. __eou__ Sounds like a plan in action for me. Thanks for the tips!
I also find it a relaxing place to spend time.  And my library has a good coffee shop __eou__ I wish mine had a coffee shop! Mine just has physical and digital resources for learning. __eou__ Maybe you should start coming to my library. __eou__ If it's close, I will definitely make that happen. Coffee and learning make a great combo __eou__ Speaking of learning, how did you do on Mr. Lempke's exam? __eou__ I aced it as usual! __eou__ Nice, me too. Did you get points for the extra credit? __eou__ I made sure to complete the extra credit part, so yes, I got those points. __eou__ Good job, I got a 105% with the extra points. __eou__ Wow! It's always great to do better than perfect. __eou__ And I love to be perfect. __eou__ It's my goal with everything I do. __eou__ Maybe one day you will reach that goal! ;) __eou__ That's the plan. Little progressive steps is the key.
I think it will take Elon Musk to make the flight faster, though. __eou__ Do you think Elon Musk and Space X will achieve their aspirational goal of putting humans on Mars by 2024? Will you be the first on that maiden voyage? __eou__ The 5 of us will be the first on the voyage as well as the ones who fund it the most! __eou__ wow . do you think you will get to mars in your lifetime ? __eou__ Well yeah, like I said, we are going to be on the 1st voyage, which will hopefully be in 2024. __eou__ Congrats, in order! Need to have a celebration dinner. Just NO beets, I can't stand them __eou__ The only ones I like are candied beets, but those are on a rare occasion. __eou__ My mom likes them also, YUCK! I can't cook either. So may have to cater that dinner before you go to Mars __eou__ Shawns catering is my favorite just in case you needed to know. __eou__ Haven't heard of them. What kind of food do they make? __eou__ Mostly barbecue, but some greek food. __eou__ MMM..I love some barbecue and big heaping of tangy slaw __eou__ My favorite is the brisket and burnt ends. __eou__ Oh now you're just making me hungry! lol
how do you do that ? i'll bet it tastes really fresh . __eou__ it does taste pretty fresh . do you have any animals on your ranch ? __eou__ Yes a goat __eou__ I didn't realize ranches had goats. I've always thought of cattle or horses. Do you have those also? __eou__ yes __eou__ That's fantastic! You must love it? Becky and I looked at some property in the country. It was beautiful, but Becky wanted to be closer to her family. __eou__ Yes i do. In my year of cheerleading I would help out with the horses. __eou__ Cheerleading and horses! How interesting. Do you have other hobbies also? __eou__ I also like to dance  __eou__ You must be a natural athlete! Do you want to go out dancing sometime with Becky and me? __eou__ Yes i would love that __eou__ There are a couple of places in town we like to go. You can stop by first and see our new place, if you want. __eou__ Where are you guys from? __eou__ Romeo, Michigan. How far is your ranch from there?
I was at home and last minute my dad took me to the Yankees game. __eou__ That is so thoughtful of him, did you guys catch a ball?  __eou__ Haha, not that time. That was a different time. __eou__ Oh shoot. Hey next week my dad and I are going fishing if you want to join us. Maybe you can catch something then. __eou__ Oh, I'd really appreciate that! Are you bringing your son with you too? __eou__ No, he is going to stay with his mom, Helga, that weekend. __eou__ Ah well, a nice weekend with just the three of us then? Maybe even bring some hotdogs and marshmellows for s'mores? __eou__ I think we had planned on going on just the day trip, like after breakfast to before supper. __eou__ Oh, I see. Well a nice day at the river isn't so bad. Did I ever tell you about the day my grandfather and I flipped our canoe?  __eou__ No, do we have time to tell it now? __eou__ Oh, I think probably not. But the short of it is that I'd never seen my grandfather so flustered in my life __eou__ Oh I can only imagine. __eou__ Serves him right for forcing me out on the river, if you ask me __eou__ Oh I did not know he forced you on the river!
I bet that was amazing. That's in Florida right? __eou__ Yep. Clearwater is in Pinellas County near Tampa here on the Gulf coast of Florida. Nowadays I live in Palm Harbor. __eou__ Gosh I love the beach and wish I could go back. __eou__ i've been to clearwater before, it's a pretty nice area. Say, did you do anything for Halloween? __eou__ NO, Terrance just wanted to stay home this year so we didn't go out or anything. Did you do anything? __eou__ Not really. Just grabbed some pizza and spent some time in watching movies. __eou__ What movie did you 2 watch? __eou__ Ferris Bueller's Day off! Not Halloween themed, but it was good __eou__ The parade scene is probably as Halloweeny as that movie gets. __eou__ lol, right! Seen anything lately? __eou__ Terrance and I have been watching the Scream movie series. __eou__ Oh those are scary! __eou__ Oh a little, we have been watching for the satyr. __eou__ Well in that case, I guess I better start hiding!
I do love coffee.  How about you?  From where does coffee come?   __eou__ the plant has been exported from african countries to countries all around the world! __eou__ I wonder how it tastes in Libya. __eou__ I don't think it would taste much different in Libya. Except maybe a little fresher? __eou__ My late husband had some Nigerian coffee two years ago, but I think he was speaking in code. Have you had foreign drinks? __eou__ I have not! That sounds like it would be amazing. Coffee is easily one of the most popular drinks in the world __eou__ Easily now but I believe it may have been a struggle at first, since most folks drank beer. __eou__ I've never liked the taste of beer. Do you? __eou__ It's an acquired taste, and after years of not drinking I'd say no. It makes me nauseous. Now coffee, that's a proper drink and laxative. Would you disagree? __eou__ I don't really like coffee at all! I drank coffee in college to stay awake but it's too bitter for me. __eou__ Perhaps orange juice would be better for everyone. Less jitters. Less offense to others. Same bowel motivation. __eou__ I like orange juice but not with pulp. Do you like orange juice with pulp or without? __eou__ Pulp is rather necessary for that full bodied texture. Otherwise I' __eou__ Ugh, the mere thought of pulp makes me gag
Yes very dangerous. I have constant worry when he is at work or out. I'm glad to live in United states __eou__ Me too! What is his rank? I know it start off from Deputy Commissioner, all the way to a Detective, and many in between? __eou__ He just became detective. It's very exciting for us all! __eou__ OH! We should throw you 2 a party. Can everyone come over? __eou__ Haha he's not a man of parties. Maybe we can have you over for dinner one week __eou__ That would be great. I can cook since we are celebrating you both. __eou__ You're very kind, but I want to cook you dish from my home too __eou__ Oh alright, I will allow it. What will you be making? __eou__ Lamb stuffed cabbage, will you eat? __eou__ It sounds amazing. __eou__ It's very good. My husband loves them __eou__ What day should we come over? __eou__ Could you come for Saturday lunch? Just before dusk? __eou__ Works perfect for me. See you then.
a few years ago . do you do anything for fun ? __eou__ i love caring for animals , i've many pets . my weirdest is probably a pet skunk ! __eou__ A pet skunk? You're not afraid of being sprayed? __eou__ nope haha . my pet skunk is currently running around . __eou__ So what kind of name do you give to a skunk? You call it Flower like in Bambi or something? __eou__ LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future. __eou__ *rolls eyes* Of course you'd like it. Weirdo...lol So what's another weird pet you have? __eou__ Maybe a cat. They are really sassy. __eou__ And temperamental as anything. I have scratches all over my arms from cats...*makes hissing noises* __eou__ lol the things we do for a cat __eou__ A pet I'd like to have is a snake...I find them fascinating. However they also terrify me so not sure how well that would work. __eou__ Oh snakes terrify me, I don't think I could ever keep one as a pet. __eou__ I'll most likely go with a dog. Boring but loveable as all hell and a lot less crazy than a cat. __eou__ i am more of a dog person , love their playful personalities ! cats are sweet though __eou__ It's been fun. Take care.
Me too, they make such nice looking cars.\ __eou__ The company was founded in 1916 and the headquarters are in Munich, Bavaria. __eou__ I had no idea! You would think since I drive one, I would know the history.  __eou__ I really appreciate the level of safety that BMWs have. __eou__ Oh, I do too! It helps me feel safe every time I drive it! __eou__ But do you actually drive safely? __eou__ I feel I do for the most part, but I do drive a little bit over he speed limit sometimes. __eou__ In Germany, there are some parts that have no speed limits. __eou__ I would love to go to Germany and drive on the autobahn. Germany also has nice shopping malls!! lol __eou__ I haven't heard about their shopping. All I know is that they're great engineers. __eou__ Dusseldorf has great Fashion districts! Yes, they are defiantly known for having great engineers.  __eou__ I must look into their shopping. If it's anything like their engineering, then I'll be intrigued. __eou__ Then again, I have a shopping addiction, or so my husband says! lol __eou__ I may have a slight addiction myself. __eou__ What's that?
i think i talk way too fast to ever command a dog of anything . do you ? __eou__ i've two . lucille and dixon . __eou__ Do you think it's important to talk slowly to get a dog to listen to you? __eou__ Yeah definitely, at least most of the time. __eou__ I really wish I could get a dog to listen to me. I want to get one __eou__ Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious. __eou__ That would be really funny. What do you think your dogs would say? __eou__ I always figure they are just yelling "Hey!" with each bark. So what is your favorite food? __eou__ I love white cheddar macaroni and cheese. What's yours?
I've been hard at work studying for my math final all this week. __eou__ have you taken the test yet __eou__ No I havent, have you? __eou__ No I only took the class to experience something out of the box but I never did anything more with it. That's my brother __eou__ Oh awesome, so what would you usually enjoy experiencing? __eou__ I'm more into film. Like to watch old French and Italian movies __eou__ That sounds interesting, although not my usual scene. __eou__ So what's your scene?  __eou__ I like to get out on my skateboard. I'm usually out quite late! __eou__ Cowabunga! Skateboard is super cool! How long have you skated for? __eou__ Haha, I love that word, 'Cowabunga!', I've skated since I was early teens... Have you ever tried? __eou__ No, I've always been too afraid of climbing on one of those __eou__ Oh don't be! It's nothing that knee and elbow pads can't help with :) __eou__ Haha, are you telling me you wear those?  __eou__ Always ;)
4 __eou__ Four is a pretty cool number. I am a bigger fan of 5, though. __eou__ Yeah my favorite number is 32. __eou__ I was 44 in football. It has stuck with me since. __eou__ Ugh the number 44 reminds me of the acres I had on my farm it just got foreclosed on. __eou__ Oh wow. I'm sorry to hear that. __eou__ It's ok. I've been wanting to move somewhere warmer __eou__ Warmer? I love colder places. __eou__ What do you like about the cold??? __eou__  I like to bundle up and drink hot chocolate by a fire. __eou__ I love hot chocolate in the winter.Its pretty to drink around Christmas time. __eou__ Christmas is my favorite holiday! __eou__ I love Christmas too!!!! I love to look at all the pretty light. __eou__ Some of the houses around here have competitions with lights.
Thank you for asking! I'm ambivalent. I don't really care all that much. I'm not a user, but I think it should be legalized. So, I guess I do support it. __eou__ I find that I agree with you. It's benefits both in the medical and recreational areas are both very positive. I find we are heading in a positive direction. __eou__ I actually do really like weed and I think that it is beneficial for many people __eou__ Yeah. As much as it can have negative side effects for society, it can do good too. __eou__ yeah my father works at a stifel and has seen that first hang __eou__ I've traveled around quite a bit and I always feel like the countries that legalized weed have themselves figured out much more. __eou__ yeah that is totally true __eou__ Weed being demonized was totally a tactic to target minorities (especially in the US) __eou__ really? tell me more about that I am not very educated on that topic __eou__ Well, people of colour are much more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people even though they consume the same amount __eou__ that is so unfair but I can see how that is true, there is so much inequality stil __eou__ One of the founders of ben and jerry's said he wouldn't have been able to start the company if he was black __eou__ wow i love ben and jerry's i did not know that __eou__ I've loved Ben and Jerry's for a while, but that video I saw was really eye-opening
i agree with you , i need to live and pursue my dreams . __eou__ yeah what is your dreams __eou__ I write poetry. It would be nice to make a living off it. __eou__ That sounds amazing! I have always loved jobs using creativity.  __eou__ Yeah done a bit of everything. Theatre, Spoken Word. I took an Art Class, but turns out I can't draw or paint a lick. __eou__ I can't paint or draw either! My mom was the artist in the family.  __eou__ The one time you actually wish you were like your parents lol. What kind of creative job would you like to do? __eou__ I wish I could be like my mother, but never my father. I would be a singer for sure! __eou__ I love karaoke. And sometimes in the shower I imagine I sound great but secretly I know that I don't. It would be amazing though. __eou__ Yes, It would!! It would be amazing to get rich and buy all the burritos I wanted. lol __eou__ So that's your favourite food is it? Personally I'm a cheeseaholic. __eou__ Yes, but I love cheese also! The more on my burrito the better!! __eou__ Mmmmmmm *makes rapturous drool face.*Think this is my last turn, but it's been fun chatting. __eou__ Yes, now I'm hungry! I am going to have to go eat after this!! lol
I am so glad that I wake up every day! __eou__ Yes! life is a blessing, and we need to make the most of every day. __eou__ That's a motto that I live by. __eou__ yes , life is wonderful and we need to be grateful . __eou__ I agree. Do you meditate? __eou__ No. I like taking photo. __eou__ That can be a type of meditation. A beautiful picture can do great things for the mind. __eou__ Nah I don't think so. Photography is an art. Meditation is just placebo. __eou__ It may be a placebo, but it puts a smile on my face. __eou__ As long as it works for you pal.  __eou__ I've always had an interest in photography. The cameras seem so expensive, though. __eou__ Are they? I don't find them expensive. __eou__ I'm not exactly wealthy, so I guess it's more of a perception thing. __eou__ No it's a rich or poor thing. 
Interesting. I first fell in love with it while living in New York city. __eou__ Salsa originated in New York in the 1970s! __eou__ Did it really, I would have figured Spain. __eou__ I know!

I'm currently taking a teach __eou__ What is taking a teach? __eou__ Sorry, I accidentally hit the enter key. I am currently taking my associate level teaching exam in Ballroom. I am finding te amount of turn challenging to remember! __eou__ I have found it easiest to block everything out and simply listen to the music. __eou__ That doesn't help for your oral exam though! __eou__ Oh, yes, you are right. __eou__ What other interests do you have? I love driving my van around doing odds and ends __eou__ I have been getting into browsing stocks more right now. __eou__ Now that does sound interesting! Tell me more

I just love the way they look. __eou__ I know right, they are incredibly cute and mischeivous  __eou__ I bet they're strong, too. __eou__ Yeah, they must be __eou__ Do you like apes? __eou__ They're ok, i believe they are clever __eou__ Most of them are. They're very closely related to humans. __eou__ Yes, they are indeed... evolution hey! __eou__ That's right! It's an interesting thing to see evolution over the centuries. __eou__ Definitely. I wonder when we evolved from having less toes like apes, to 5 toes as humans __eou__ I'm sure it has something to do with walking all of the time. __eou__ and balance perhaps? I only have 3 toes on the right foot though
I am on the fence about pursuing a promotion opportunity at my work. I am nervous that I may not interview well. __eou__ Don't be.I am sure you are ready. __eou__ You're are right, I shouldn't be afraid of a great opportunity. __eou__ That's the spirit!

I also turned very clean, for instance I am now a vegetarian __eou__ So have you researched any of the CBD treatments that are available? I have heard great things about the CBD oils  __eou__ I haven't actually, what have you heard? __eou__ Some people have had amazing results using CBD. Tumors shrink, disappear. Others have had no success at all. I guess it all depends on the person. __eou__ Perhaps I should go ahead and try it! __eou__ From what I have read and heard about it, my opinion is that it can't hurt. If it helps that's a bonus __eou__ I will lok into buying some, thank you for the advice __eou__ You are welcome. There are so many different types of cancer that if a person can find something that will help them it's a blessing. __eou__ Yes, you're right. Have you had any other friends with cancer?
Once I couldn't resist that glass of whiskey, even though I promised my wife I wouldn't. __eou__ Did she find out you broke your promise? __eou__ Yeah...I made her a cup of tea before telling her...honey maybe you should drink this lol... __eou__ Lol I hear it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. __eou__ yep and hopefully know some dirty secret about the other person to guilt them out of being angry lol. __eou__ It's tough to hold in secrets. __eou__ Yeah I just spit it out...otherwise it just festers you know. Like a silent subtext. An invisible wall that's always there but never talked about. __eou__ People say they want the truth, but they usually freak out whenever they get it. __eou__ Yeah us humans are remarkably indecisive about what we want. Half the times what we think we do we actually don't. __eou__ Most of use are scared to look inside our own minds and try to better ourselves. __eou__ Nope and that's one of the reasons people settle for partners that are less than ideal. That way you aren't challenged. __eou__ I completely agree. We turn into zombies. __eou__ I like watching zombie movies, but being one isn't much fun. __eou__ Zombie movies are my favorite!

When you get that whole "you're not my mother" routine. __eou__ It definitely can be. I'm sure he knows you love him though. __eou__ Yeah he's just at that rebellious young teenager phase where he's figuring things out. Adults are the enemy. Fight the power! __eou__ All when can do is be there for them when they need us.  __eou__ Yeah and he always comes to me eventually or apologizes after doing something hurtful. He's a good kid. __eou__ He really is a good kid.  __eou__ *holds up glass of water in a toast* To good kids! __eou__ To good kids! __eou__ Cheers! *clinks glasses* __eou__ Clink clink!

I travel alone mostly, my family is kinda crazy.  __eou__ I am fortunate my daughters and I get along, they make great companions. __eou__ I get along with my family, but sometimes they have weird thoughts. My brother mainly, he thinks he is a viking. __eou__ My extended family can drive me crazy, but I do my best to avoid them __eou__ I totally understand that! I try to keep myself busy to avoid them. __eou__ It can be tough when we meet for holidays, but laughter helps. __eou__ All family get togethers are tough, yes! lol The last one I kept myself busy hiding in my room, painting my nails green.
Feeling quite confident going in to this exam. __eou__ Oh yeah? What is the exam for? I hope you do well. __eou__ It's a calculus exam. Thanks! __eou__ Calculus 1? __eou__ Yup. It is for my degree program. __eou__ What is your degree? Do you have to get more math classes after this? __eou__ My degree is engineering. Yes, I will also have to take physics. __eou__ Physics? That must be crazy hard. __eou__ Yeah it is. My brother said that only about half the class passed when he took it.  __eou__ My mother teaches it at the high school level, but I guess I didn't get the math genes in the family. __eou__ That's ok. I bet your great at a ton of other things. __eou__ Ah, thanks. Mostly I just like to mountain bike. __eou__ Thats so cool! Have you biked in any cool places? __eou__ There are some great trails in the Appalachians.
I lovve to read too, But I've never been in a book club.  How do you like it? __eou__ It book discussion club . A group of people meet and discuss a book and tell express their opinions __eou__ Is it enjoyable? __eou__ So far. The biggest issue is when other people don't read the book and you're just uh...well I guess there's nothing to discuss. __eou__ Indeed. I enjoy going out to bars. Alcohol helps finding things to discuss. __eou__ It does. And makes me braver. I usually look for that hot nerd type to chat up. __eou__ Someone should start an alcohol club. __eou__ Or bring it to our book clubs...the hard stuff...liven the conversations. __eou__ What a great idea. __eou__ Okay I'm going to bring a giant bottle of vodka to the next one. We're discussing Dostoevsky so it's perfect. __eou__ What's your favorite Dostoevsky? __eou__ Only read a couple so far. I loved Crime and Punishment. __eou__ I haven't read anything of his. __eou__ Well it's a good one to start on. A great, psychological book. What goes on in the human mind.
I can imagine those little Corgis carrying the rings.I wonder where this tradition got its start? __eou__ Well is a formal wedding the ring bearer is a special page who carries the rings on a pillow. __eou__ My St.Bernard will be carrying the ring in a tiny little beer barrel attached to his collar. __eou__ Yes great idea what kind of dog is he, I had a dog growing up I loved Buddy he was a greater swiss mountain dog. __eou__ I believe we are talking about the same breed of dog. They were a rescue dog designed for high altitudes. __eou__ I wonder how many movies they have made about these rescue dogs. __eou__ When we honeymoon at Niagra, it may be useful to have both: old movies and a rescue dog. Will you attend the wedding? __eou__ I would love to attend the wedding. I can attend any time thanks to my schedule. __eou__ Open schedules are magnificent, yes?  I got so bored that I decided to marry just to fill the time. __eou__ That's the pleasure of working from home. Maybe I'll make a movie out of your wedding! __eou__ As long as my role is played by Rip Taylor, I don't think that'll be a problem. __eou__ It's your wedding, after all. Whatever role you want. __eou__ You're absolutely right! Perhaps I will be my own ring bearer as well. That way I can walk down the aisle twice.  __eou__ got it , cat glasses , frumpy dresses , and whatever is your drink of choice .
I was at the grocery store yesterday and did something I am not proud of. The cashier gave me too much money back and when I realized it I didn't say anything and kept it. __eou__ Did you need the money for something specific?  __eou__ No, but I had already left the store and I figured "why bother?" __eou__ That makes a lot of sense. Sometime that's just how it goes though. __eou__ Yeah, I mean, the cashier has a bit of leeway. Don't they? __eou__ Sometimes. I suppose it depends on the store policies.  __eou__ Well, like I said- I'm not proud of continuing on my way. I should have returned to the store. __eou__ You still can if you it's something that's still bothering you. __eou__ I wouldn't dare. I'd be so humiliated if anyone else knew! __eou__ It's not something to be embarrassed about. It happens all the time, and may clear the name of the cashier. It may also make you feel better about it.  __eou__ You may be right. __eou__ Just do what you feel would be best.  __eou__ I'm sure I'll feel better after my wine. __eou__ Maybe. What is your favorite kind of wine?
It feels great having a girlfriend who puts her trust in you that you wouldn't do anything to hurt her. My current girlfriend, unlike my ex, has no problems with me going out with my friends occasionally. __eou__ That must be so nice having that freedom. __eou__ In my current relationship, there is more trust she's not insecure about me going out with friends __eou__ That is great!! It sounds like it is a good relationship.
I hadn't thought about that but that __eou__ Yeah it's interesting. The show ran for the second time during 1989-1996 with Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera all appeared on the new Mickey Mouse Club. __eou__ Britney and Christina are no longer those wholesome teenagers lol. __eou__ do they ever play justin timberlike ? i love justin timberlike ! __eou__ He doesn't put out a lot of new music anymore. Kinda depressing. __eou__ Yeah.i likes his music, but now I don't have a lot of time to listen to music college pretty much takes all my time. __eou__ Just as well since there's not much new music to listen to. What are you taking?
i work as an accountant , freelance . __eou__ that is cool , do you like it ? __eou__ Honestly, I do. I get to make my own schedule and name my price. __eou__ That's always nice! I wish I could do that! I work at a movie theater so I have set hours.   __eou__ Maybe you can start doing some work on the side. Do you have any special skills? __eou__ I am a very organized person, and have good computer skills.  __eou__ That's good. There are some online jobs that you can do in your free time. __eou__ I would like to do more work in the morning, I'm always busy at night. I work and do my running at night. __eou__ I'm sure a little extra money in the morning would give you a good start to the day. __eou__ haha, yes it would! __eou__ I say you look into it. I'm sure you can find something enjoyable. __eou__ I would probably love to some freelance  __eou__ It's definitely a great way to flex the mind. Make it happen!! __eou__ I am always bad at not making it happen though. lol 
I went skydiving a few years ago. It was a rush! __eou__ skydiving is insane to me, how did it go? what reminded you of it? __eou__ I was watching Bob Ross, my favorite artist, paint a tree on television last night. The tree looked exactly like the one I landed in. __eou__ That's hilarious. I love Bob Ross, he's got such cool hair.  __eou__ That means I have cool hair also, since I emulate obscure celebrities in every facet of my life. __eou__ That's interesting. How could you emulate every celebrity? Wouldn't that be somewhat of a paradox? OR is it only the ones you like? __eou__ Only the obscure ones. My mothers fashion line does something similar. I wish she would let me model her new line of Congressional Hairnets. __eou__ hahaha. Congressional Hairnets. I guess I could use one of those since I plan to become a nun.  __eou__ Goodness gracious! Why would you want to do that? or is it Nun of my business? __eou__ Why? What's wrong with becoming a nun? They seem pretty chill at my high school.  __eou__ Oh I forgot that nuns worked in public. I keep thinking of them as isolationists, much like we do of monks.\ __eou__ That makes sense. Some monks go out in public, but most don't work. Have you ever heard of phenomenology?  __eou__ No, but I assume it's the study of phenomenons. How off base am I? __eou__ They do! But mostly the phenomena of consciousness. It's interesting stuff. __eou__ Oh, I don't need to study consciousness. I already know all there is about existence. Any questions? __eou__ Wow, I don't think I'll ever be that certain about my own existence.  __eou__ That is correct. You never will until we all are.
I looked out my window this morning and saw a skunk staring right back at me! __eou__ Wow! How big was it? Did you smell it? __eou__ No I'm so glad I didn't tho.my dog sure wanted it.lol __eou__ Yeah doggy dinner...YUM! __eou__ Yeah he was huge.then I went back to watching my comics. Lol __eou__ Yeah seen one skunk you've seen them all I guess. __eou__ Lol.yup they are all smelly. Do you watch much TV? __eou__ Not like I used to. The last few years all the good viewing stuff is on internet streaming. __eou__ Yeah.i love Netflix and Hulu. I'm a huge couch potato. Im very picky on what I watch tho. __eou__ I don't care where I find it as long as it's good. I love me some YouTube because it's short and there's so much variety. __eou__ My daughter loves YouTube.i only listen to music on YouTube __eou__ Music is like the only thing I don't listen to online. Still like my radio for that.  __eou__ Lol.thats how you get to know all the new music on the radio. __eou__ True enough I suppose. I'm old fashioned about some things.
it sounds like the really care about you . __eou__ yes , i've amazing friends . __eou__ Yeah, I had some great friends that passed away in law school. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. If you don't mind me asking, how did your friends pass away? __eou__ They went ice fishing. Fell througn and drowned. __eou__ That's unfortunate, but at least they were doing what they loved! __eou__ Actually, they didn't want to go. It was an instructor that took them as TA's on a research expedition. __eou__ Did the instructor face any consequences afterward? That seems reckless. __eou__ No, not at all. It wasn't like that. Just a freak accident. Very unfortunate. __eou__ What's done is done, I suppose. I hope I didn't open any old wounds. __eou__ No, I'm good, man. I should hold up. __eou__ Glad to hear it.  __eou__ I'm sure you are! __eou__ So, what are you up to these days?
I never really like comics when I was young. __eou__ Batman was always worth reading. He was created by Bob Kane. __eou__ Oh, well I wouldn't know. __eou__ I like Batman because he's a regular human. He doesn't have super powers. __eou__ He just has gadgets, right? __eou__ Right. And he always conveniently has the right gadget for whatever crime he's solving. __eou__ What about Robin? Did he have to borrow all his gear from Batman? Kind of awkward, huh? __eou__ Lol I don't know how that was started. I'm sure Batman bought whatever Robin needed. __eou__ I can only imagine! __eou__ Who's your favorite hero? __eou__ I'm without the illusion of heroes, my friend. __eou__ Aww man you gotta have a little imagination with that stuff. __eou__ Not really. I did try to like them. Bought  a Venom, but never got into it. __eou__ Venom is a good one. He's an anti-hero, and that's a special niche in the comic market.
Can people make money posting videos on YouTube? __eou__ Yes you can but no specific numbers, but google did buy the site in 2006 for 1.65 billion __eou__ That's interesting. I've done some research but it seems difficult to actually get the viewers.  __eou__ S.E.O. (Seardh engine optimization) companies can help you get hits on youtube also. But they cost money to be effective. __eou__ I used to work for an SEO company, actually. Most people don't even know that term if you bring it up to random people. haha __eou__ It IS refreshing that there are still people who haven't spent that much time online.  __eou__ haha. The internet is the future, I guess. Youtube is an especially interesting place. You can learn just about anything.  __eou__ Yes, I've learned that the earth is round, flat, and shaped like a donut all at once. I learned all of this on youtube. __eou__ I guess critical thinking skills are still an important trait to have while doing just about anything, but especially when it comes to the internet.  __eou__ When I'm shopping, which I love to do, I use critical thinking to decide where to eat. Optimal outcome is always the same: Fries at the golden arches. __eou__ It seems to me that actual critical thinking skills consider a bit more than preference or taste. I guess it depends on your objective, though.  __eou__ Ones objective should always be personal satisfaction. __eou__ Maybe, but I think hedonism eventually creates chaos.  __eou__ It's fortunate that most of us are satisfied personally when we help others.
I have been trying to keep my car running perfect. I am failing." __eou__ What happened to your car? __eou__ All the stop and go traffic and hills are killing my transmission __eou__ Well, that's wear and tear. You're not to blame. __eou__ I'm sure my car disagrees since I chose to live in the Bay area...she's like coulda learned to drive better! __eou__ My car wouldn't end up like that down here in the valley. __eou__ Ever wonder if cars could talk, I mean we baby them like they're real.  Mine has a name!  __eou__ I've never named a car. __eou__ My sister thinks I'm nuts bc I have lol.   __eou__ Yeah, my family never really got that materialistic for those kinds of bad habits to rub off on me. __eou__ oh, truth, family customs and all.   __eou__ For sure. __eou__ whats something you learned from your fam __eou__ Don't talk to strangers. 
No, I have not. Though, I have been to Pennsylvania. __eou__ Where in Pennsylvania? It's a big state and the 5th most populated in the country. __eou__ Hersery Pennsylvania.The chocolate capital of the USA. __eou__ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM love me those Hershey kisses. __eou__ Oh yes. So good  I don't travel much. College and my dogs takes up pretty much all my time. __eou__ Oh what kind of dogs and what are you taking? __eou__ A pit,a blue heeler I love my dogs more than anything they are super spoiled. English,and child phycology I'm wanting to be a teacher  __eou__ Blue heelers are gorgeous. English teacher was my second choice. __eou__ That's cool. English was a favorite subject in school.yeah my blue heeler is a females and a smart dog. __eou__ Pitbulls also get a bad wrap. Just because they're big and strong and capable of doing a lot of damage. But it's never a case of bad dog. __eou__ Nope.mine is a big baby, he runs from my cat. Lol __eou__ My friend owned a rottweiler who would hide under the bed every time a new visitor came over. __eou__ Oh wow. Yeah it's usually the big dogs that are the sweetest. __eou__ Almost always. Big affectionate lugs.
I would like it longer, its past my shoulders __eou__ Ive been experimenting with letting mine grow, being male its a bit different for me, always kept it short. __eou__ Yes, you don't see many males with long hair.  Especially past the shoulders! __eou__ I understand that, attitudes about hair varies across cultures and historical periods, and age too __eou__ Definitely.  Since having kids, it seems like the 'mom' thing to do is cut your hair.  Not me I guess. __eou__ I never met my mother. I wonder if she would have cut her hair or kept it long. __eou__ Wow, it must have been difficult for you not knowing your mother.  Even the simple things like not knowing what she looked like must have been tough. __eou__ Yes it was, that is why I have dedicated my life and study to finding out what happened to her and my father. __eou__ That sounds like an interesting journey.  I'm sure it's frustrating sometimes.  Do you think you are close to finding out? __eou__ Well. The US government won't say anything, but I have come across some interesting leads in a small Russian newspaper, which lead my investigation to a library in Kabul. __eou__ Wow!  Dealing with different countries would definitely add a degree of difficulty.  Is it strange the US government won't (or can't) say anything?  That sounds very odd __eou__ It is odd! That is why I suspect that they were operatives with the CIA. But why they never came back from their last mission, I have not yet discovered. __eou__ Crazy! It sounds like a movie or TV show or video game! It would be frustrating not knowing what happened but kind of cool you have such interesting parents __eou__ Maybe I will publish a book if I am able to piece together the full story. Anonymously, of course. The government does not give up its secrets easily!
reading is one of my favorite hobbies ! __eou__ i like to read but not school texts ! i am working on my law degree . so over it ! __eou__ That *does* sound exhausting, so I can't blame you. __eou__ I fall asleep at times. It's a thing. __eou__ You may want to get a sleep study done to see if you're narcoleptic. __eou__ You think so?! __eou__ With your work load, it may not be, but if you find yourself becoming tired at odd times, it might be the right call. __eou__ Maybe I just need to cut back on the tennis. __eou__ That kind of physical activity can make it much harder to keep your energy up when doing something relaxing like reading.  __eou__ You don't have to tell me, buddy! __eou__ When it comes time for me to write after a long day, it's hard to focus on the task at hand. __eou__ Watching fish can be relaxing. It could put you in the zone. __eou__ I've never really been interested in fishing, but maybe I could give it another try. __eou__ No, I mean in an aquarium.
I do like to sew, although I don't have as much time for it as I'd like. I did some cross stitch when I was younger.  __eou__ Interesting! Are you interested in the history of sewing? Back in the paleolithic age sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and shelter __eou__ Ok, I guess that was a bit out of nowhere! __eou__ Lol...I'm a bit of a trivia geek. __eou__ Well, trivia and sewing go hand in hand... __eou__ yeah tea, knitting needles and inane knowledge. A Holy Trinity. __eou__ lol, that's the one! __eou__ Every Sunday I pray to Sister Martha of the knitting needle lol...my Patron Saint.
Really? I lived in something similar to section 8 public housing at one point. How does section 8 work? __eou__ well its considered social housing now .. its an umbrella term referring to rental housing which may be owned and managed by the state, by non-profit organizations, or by a combination of the two __eou__ I see, that's interesting. It's good that those things exist for people who need it.  __eou__ I know a woman who was actually paid 6 dollars per month to live in an apartment. That's free rent and one pack of cigarettes. __eou__ I guess so. Better than having someone homeless on the streets, especially compared to the amount of money we give billionaires for free.  __eou__ True. If that guy that invented Tesla cars would give up half a billion, it'd help quite a bit.  __eou__ Sure. Do you think it's weird how much of most people's income goes to paying rent? __eou__ I find renting as strange as typing with both hands. I type with one, and am starting to believe perhaps I'm in the minority on both accounts. __eou__ I think you might be right about that. Can you type fast when typing with only one hand? __eou__ 20 words per minute if it's not too cold in the office. 30 words per minute if my blood is warm. Summer is the superior season. __eou__ 20 wpm? That's pretty slow. Have you ever thought about learning to type with both hands online? __eou__ Oh, I can do that, but then I'd have to set down my coffee. And without the coffee I'd be typing with my face. __eou__ Or you could create some type of instrument, that is constantly feeding you coffee while you type with two hands.  __eou__ I did: my daughter. But she's still to young to hold the cup steady.
Wow! You mean you enjoy the night life? __eou__ There's a lot less people to deal with and it's quiet but in several countries night owls are considered B rated. Whereas, early birds are A people __eou__ Hmm... I've never heard of that distinction. __eou__ Yeah, people don't usually look too kindly on people who like to stay up all night. __eou__ I've always been a night owl. __eou__ A kindred spirit?! How do you spend your nights? __eou__ Chores mostly. Nothing exciting. __eou__ My wife like to clean at night, but I usually write for work. __eou__ I was just joking- I party hard in the Atlanta clubs baby!! woo-hoo!!! __eou__ I'm not much parties, myself. We live a quiet life for the most part. How's the part scene? __eou__ Man, it's so wild. People dying like flies out here we go so hard! __eou__ Why are people dying like flies? What's going on? __eou__ Overdoses. There's a batch of bad meth going around in my city. It's tragic. __eou__ That's awful. Truly a shame.
So, yesterday morning, some ingrate stole my cappuccino at Starbucks. __eou__ How did that happen? I would be so upset. __eou__ I went in to pick up my order and someone had already taken it __eou__ That's preposterous. A real crime. Did you tell the baristas what happened? __eou__ I did.  they gave me another on.  I love Starbucks...almost as much as I love Burritos! __eou__ Burritos and Starbucks don't sound like they go together very well, so I hope these were different meals. What's your drink order? __eou__ lol  I know.  I was picking up for later.  I just like cappuccino __eou__ Interesting. I think that could be made into a movie. It's got everything. Love, loss, and the inevitable hopelessness of being.  __eou__ thats me.  my life is a drama! __eou__ Interesting. So what's your favorite movie? __eou__ action and suspense.  I really like the hunt for red October.  I watched it again last week __eou__ Wow! I have a ton of movies but haven't seen that one. What's it about? __eou__ stealing a russian submarine.  Its a jack ryan movie.  The first one I think __eou__ Oh, interesting. I've never seen it myself, but I would be interested in checking it out sometime. 
Last weekend I was dragged to a live piano performance at a local concert hall.  I came away thinking it might have been one of the best live shows I have ever seen! __eou__ That's great, from the sound of it, your probably thought it was going to be boring, huh? __eou__ I find them quite long, but once I got a bit of coffee into me it was easier to pay attention and get into it. Very talented musician. __eou__ Well, I love live music! It's best with bacon and jello. maybe. __eou__ Bacon is always a good way to start things!  I can't wait for the weekend and make some bacon and eggs for breakfast.   __eou__ Right! I love eggs too! __eou__ What's your favourite way to make them?  I love sunny side up and scrambled sometimes __eou__ Tacos, man. __eou__ That sounds kind of weird!  But in Italy once, I saw pizza with a sunny side up egg right in the middle of it so who knows! __eou__ You've never had an egg taco?! __eou__ I haven't, no!  Is it just a regular taco with egg in it?  How is the egg cooked?  Like scrambled before putting it in the taco? __eou__ Yeah, just a scrambled egg and tortilla. __eou__ I'll have to try that some time.  Sounds like a good snack for when I'm working (I draw professionally) __eou__ Wow, do you draw skaters and weirdo-people like me? __eou__ I'm a cartoonist so I absolutely draw weirdos!  Especially like you!
you are a great dr . thank you . i feel so much better about myself ! __eou__ i'm glad i could help you . __eou__ would you like a pastry as thanks? __eou__ I thought I informed you that you couldn't handle any food due to risk of cross contimination. This is serious. __eou__ I suppose you are right, I just have such a passion for baked goods, cake is a big part of my life __eou__ Well, now that all needs to change. Are you hungry in your mouth or stomach? Stay focused on your weight. __eou__ Good point. I may have to distract myself with other things, what do you think  __eou__ I think that is exactly what you need. __eou__ Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of a collector. I have an extensive collection of small toys wearing little raincoats. Do you collect anything? __eou__ no. __eou__ what would you use to distract youself then, if you were in my position? __eou__ I think you should find an app or reader that you could use instead.  __eou__ Great idea, I love reading recipe books, maybe I could do that on an e-reader. Thanks. __eou__ You're welcome. I'm just glad we could stop this from getting out of hand.
you like bill nye ? mexico is neat , i went when i was a youngster __eou__ not justvwith work but i am ocd in general . everything has to be perfect and its exhausting __eou__ I can understand that. Nothing really ever is perfect. Must be a lot of effort. __eou__ Trying to save the world must be hard. I may work too much but not enough when it comes to conservation. __eou__ Me either. I take out the garbage and try not to litter. That's about the extent of my fabulous contributions to the cause. __eou__ If you search youtube for "melody sheep"   "bill nye" you will see a most wonderful video. Watching things like this is the extent of my contribution. __eou__ lol it's more than me. __eou__ Yeah, i need a vacation from all my work. I should use the vacation to do some charity... __eou__ I suppose if you want to. But it could be the whole OCD thing. Maybe you're being a bit hard on yourself. __eou__ Obsessing compulsively about my disorders is rather exhausting. How have you been feeling the last few days/ __eou__ Not too bad...The weather has gotten super cold though. Not a big fan of forced hibernation. __eou__ We should carve stone monuments so that when we freeze to death, the next dominant species can learn about us in the future. __eou__ Good plan. What do you want them to know about you? __eou__ Very little. Perhaps that while the world was on fire, and I yet froze to death, I never forgot the alamo.
The word I ment was stale __eou__ That's true. Most of the 126 original series they have aren't good so you get through the good ones quickly. __eou__ That's the way it goes, or the original is good and later ones are lackluster. Consistent quality is hard to come by. __eou__ very true. The end of Game of Thrones gutted my sensibilities for expecting quality to be consistent.  __eou__ Game of Thrones is the perfect example. It was one of the best things on TV for awhile, then it became trash. __eou__ I absolutely agree. Hopefully the directors are ashamed of what they created. They ruined a perfectly great series. __eou__ I don't think rich people are capable of shame. __eou__ I definitely agree. If they were, there wouldn't be billionaires.  __eou__ It takes a certain underhandedness to get to the top. __eou__ Absolutely. And cognitive dissonance to ignore the exploitation of the working class.  __eou__ What can you do? All I know to do is binge watch videos to get through the day. __eou__ It makes sense. As they say, netflix is the opiate of the masses. Or did I get that quote wrong? __eou__ Seems legit. __eou__ Unfortunately, even the shows can betray you. I need a good steak. Do you think they have some in Canada?
I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow. __eou__ I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow. __eou__ Oh! You're going to an interview too? I just moved here and this interview is super important to me. __eou__ I'm really excited to interview for this job.  I hope I get it! __eou__ Well that's certainly something i can relate to, i'm pretty nervous but I think I've got this. How do you prepare for an interview? __eou__ Well I eat a well balanced meal the night before and exercise in the morning __eou__ Sounds smart, I like to put on some music beforehand to get me into the zone myself. __eou__ Thats a good idea too.  I may try that.  I list to music when I rollerblade __eou__ Oh, cool, what sort of stuff do you listen to, i'm a big fan of Jason Mraz myself/ __eou__ classic rock for the win!  Van Halen, Bon Jovi, etc __eou__ Can't argue with the classics, nothing like a 80s power ballad when out on a run or at the gym __eou__ yesss!  love the power ballads too.  timeless! __eou__ Well, good luck with your interview, it's been nice chatting to you __eou__ thanks!  good luck with your interview too.  I hope you get it
Hi! Dancing is one of my favorite things to do!  __eou__ Same! Ecstatic dancing though is my favorite!because it's like this free form of dancing! __eou__ An ancient king named David wrote that we should dance and make a joyful noise.  __eou__ What kind of noise is that? __eou__ If my spelling is correct, I think it's like "woo-hoo!" or as the kids say: "wooot" __eou__ Can you imagine walking to work one day and you see someone dancing and saying woot? What would you do? __eou__ I'd try to steal their winning lottery ticket. __eou__ What would you do with the money?  __eou__ I'd build a church. I'm not particularly religeous, but I do enjoy watching a group in prayer together. Strange? __eou__ Yes. I'd buy office supplies. __eou__ There's an OfficeMax across the way from the gym I work out in while listening to christian edm. Do you collect office suppllies? __eou__ I like owning the really nice stuff. Stupid expensive pens are my specialty. __eou__ You better stay away from my collection of vintage parchment. The temptation must be too much... __eou__ I will see to your vintage parchment. And it will be mine.
Do you have an accent from anywhere? __eou__ Well yes i do! from venezuela! often accent is a subset of dialect!  __eou__ I have a slight southern United States accent, but I can't hear it compared to the people around me. __eou__ My accent is quite thick still.  Some big words are quite difficult for me. __eou__ Your English seems pretty strong, though. Excellent work. English is supposedly pretty hard for non native speakers to learn. __eou__ Thank you it indeed was a bit of a challenge.  Do you have any pets? __eou__ I have a dog. He's a Siberian husky. What about you? __eou__ I have a dog also.  His name is Wonwon.  He is a german shepard. __eou__ My dog's name is Kubrick, after the director. __eou__ that is awesome ! what movies did he direct ? __eou__ The Shining is one of the most well known. It has a sequel coming out, apparently? My favorites are 2001 and A Clockwork Orange, though. __eou__ The Shining is a great movie for sure! __eou__ What is your favorite movie? __eou__ napoleon dynamite . what is yours ? __eou__ Probably Princess Mononoke. __eou__ that is a very good movie . i , personally , love disney movies .
On my birthday my parents give me a decent sized check __eou__ Thats awesome. I love getting money as a gift.  Then you get to spend it how you want __eou__ thats right!  money is the best gift.  I need it for the kids! __eou__ Makes sense, I don't have any myself so my money goes towards skiing gear mostly. How many kids do you have? __eou__ I have 4.  so we have our hands full! __eou__ I can imagine, are they getting anything special with the money or are you going to spend it more on day to day stuff? __eou__ mostly day to day stuff....but we just got a cat, so cats toys are in the future __eou__ Lucky them! I'm allergic to cats so the closest I come to them is the cheetah on the side of my Cheetos packets. __eou__ haha  thats funny.  my kids love the new kitty and it keeps them busy __eou__ I'm sure a bit of relief is a blessing, how old are they? __eou__ My kids are 14, 10, 8 and 2.  two boys and two girls.  __eou__ Wow, that's quite the range, it must be pretty hectic __eou__ yes....we stay VERY busy.  I love it though __eou__ Sounds great, its been nice chatting with you
that's great . where about do you both live ? __eou__ i live in vegas . right by all casinos __eou__ I reside in a rather large city, but it's not as progressive as your home. Gamble much? __eou__ I do. Every weekend. I like to see if my karma is acting as it should and reevaluate my life accordingly. __eou__ My studies indicate that since you are still alive, you are living well. __eou__ Is that right. What kind of studies? __eou__ I majored in american literature and education, but the studies I'm referring to are the works of heroditus and plato. __eou__ Interesting. I'm more of a Hegel and Marx kinda gal. I'd say Plato might disagree with you a bit on that __eou__ Catherine Hegel and Groucho Marx? __eou__ HA. No. I'm a fan of the Georg Wilhelm Hegel's dialectic and Karl Marx's interpretation of that. Heraclitus seems somewhat related.  __eou__ No kidding! As a native of Ephesus, you know I love those philosophies. __eou__ It's very interesting stuff. That's very exciting. Have you visited any of the landmarks? __eou__ Only the ones on the west coast. I don't rent any houses, but Ionian. __eou__ Interesting. What is Ionian? __eou__ That was a pun.
I'm gone vegetarian for over a year now. I wonder how my blood results will be __eou__ I bet they will be a lot better, I heard vegetarian helps a lot with that. __eou__ Here's hoping. It's been tricky to give up vices like burgers, but at least I can still enjoy eggs and cheese. __eou__ Yeah, I've been thinking about doing it myself, but I love meat a little bit too much. How did you get into it, was it difficult? __eou__ It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, but it also wasn't easy. I just had to keep reminding myself why I wanted to make the change. __eou__ Was it the blood results that got you into it, or was it more of a moral choice? __eou__ It was more motivated by my health, but the moral element made it easier not to look back. __eou__ That's commendable, I'm struggling with the morality at the moment, I write children's books with these black and white morals, it really puts my meat eating into perspective __eou__ Oh, you're a writer? What have you written? __eou__ I mostly focus on children's books, I don't have any myself but its a joy to go to a reading and see their faces light up. Its also super fun. __eou__ I imagine it would be. I like to draw people I know, and it would be fun to put that work illustrating a story. __eou__ Why not give it a go, I didn't realise how great writing was until I tried it, do you like to draw any other stuff? __eou__ I haven't really tried to expand my repertoire yet. I need to get outside of my comfort zone. __eou__ Hey, why don't we do a deal, you try some illustrating, and I'll give vegetarianism a go. Let 
Jimmy Hendrix performed at Woodstock didn't he? __eou__ Yes, he and Billy Cox from the Band of Gypsys performed at Woodstock.  Wish I was old enough to have attended! __eou__ I really wish he were still around __eou__ How come? What do you think would change? OR do you just want to hear him in Concert? __eou__ I would love to hear him in concert.  I never got the chance __eou__ I see. Me neither. Do you ever go to see concerts? __eou__ I try to, but it's hard to work into my schedule with work and family __eou__ That makes sense. What kind of music do you usually listen to? __eou__ I like mostly classic rock and southern rock __eou__ I see. Whats your favorite band of all time? __eou__ If I had to choose, I would say Toto. What about you? __eou__ Interesting. I'm not entirely sure, I'd probably say Bright Eyes because of the lyrics in their later albums. __eou__ I don't know much about them.  What album would you recommend I start with? __eou__ Hmm, it depends on what you're into but Cassadaga is an excellent album.  __eou__ Ok, I'll give that a listen.  What other hobbies do you have besides listening to music?
What does the Human Society do? __eou__ Humane Society is a group that helps with human or animal suffering. __eou__ My business has donated to the Humane Society.  I believe it does important work. __eou__ Yes, it does. It's an amazing feeling of satisfaction you get by helping people in need, specially innocent animals. 
I love to work on cars myself. __eou__ that muhst be really rewarding. can you fix my2003 kia optima? __eou__ Heavens no. I only work on cars that are older than I am. Do they make a 1981 kia? __eou__ Ha, I was just kidding. You must get people asking you to work on their cars all the time. __eou__ Certainly do, and as an artist they insist I put my special touch on it. __eou__ As long as they pay you what you're worth! __eou__ I work on cars but prefer to hike. I imagine a cobbler prefers to ride. What __eou__ I like to cook. I love trying new recipes. __eou__ Yeah? What're we having for dinner tonight? And do you have enough wine for the both of us? __eou__ Sesame chicken. And sake to go along with it! __eou__ For goodness SAKE, I will be there shortly. __eou__ Well, come on! I'm tired of eating by myself and having no one to cook for. __eou__ As soon as i figure out which shoe goes on which foot, I can depart. So it may be a few hours before I get out the door. __eou__ Great! I'll keep the chicken warm. 
i am nervous , as per usual . __eou__ if you eat healthier like me it could help with those nerves . __eou__ What do you mean by "eat healthier"? __eou__ You could try and cut down on carbs and drink more water every day! __eou__ I guess I could try that.  I do like to eat popcorn while I am watching Netflix though! __eou__ Oh man, I was watching Netflix way too late last night. Hence why I slept in this morning! __eou__ I wish I could have slept in!  But I've always got to be at the family store on Sundays __eou__ Do you guys sell hair dye at the family store? I have brown hair but I want to try to dye my hair red. __eou__ No, my family owns an appliance store.  It's been in the family 3 generations __eou__ Oh that is great. It stinks you have to work on Sunday though. __eou__ Yeah, thats the trouble with a small family business I guess.  Why do you want to dye your hair? __eou__ I am just tired of having brown hair I guess! __eou__ I understand wanting to make a change!  I've thought a lot about making a career change __eou__ What new career do you want to go into? __eou__ I'm not sure.  Just don't love being in the appliance business.
i'm a professional paid grandmother __eou__ a professional paid grandmother ? do you want me to make you a rocking chair ? __eou__ I love rocking chairs! __eou__ i'll get to cooking, but know that this rocking chair will cost you dearly. As a pro bowler taking time from bowling costs me bigtime. __eou__ How much would it cost? __eou__ Only about 8K __eou__ Wow 8,000. I'd have to work a lot for that. __eou__ Well, they are hand crafted and frankly my father, a retired policeman needs my help. 8K would would do, please help __eou__ I am a professional grandmother and also a chicken plucker. I would have to pluck for hours. __eou__ Shoot. This is making things hard for me. Umm, need an extra hand with the plunking? __eou__ I can trade feathers __eou__ Are feathers in high demand? __eou__ Feathers are worth a lot. I can trade 5 bags of feathers and a country music cd. __eou__ For the rocking chair? You promise they're worth a lot? Like 8k, so I can help out my dad?
ha and i'm eating ice cream __eou__ i have a flower arrangement that would go well with the ice cream __eou__ What kind of flower arrangement? __eou__ It is an orchid arrangement. You know us vegetarians, we love our plants! __eou__ Orchids were the flowers that were at my parents' funeral. __eou__ Oh man I am sorry to hear that your parents died. __eou__ Thank you, you are kind. Are you parents still alive? __eou__ They are both alive but I don't talk to my mom anymore because she hates how many old books I read. __eou__ What kinds of old books do you read? __eou__ They are mostly books about psychology. And flowers. __eou__ What an interesting combination! __eou__ What is your favorite flower? __eou__ Sunflowers __eou__ T
haha i bet its beautiful . any hobbies ? __eou__ it is thanks , no hobbies but cooking . you ? __eou__ I like doing solitary stuff, reading, listerning to music, etc. __eou__ That's interesting! What's your favorite book? __eou__ I've been enjoying a lot of stuff recently, I like Lord of the Rings though __eou__ Oh that's interesting. I've heard Tolkein is amazing at world building. I'm not much for fantasy, generally, though. __eou__ Yeah, I can understand that, A lot of people don't like the floury language from Tolkein, but the world is amazing. What do you read? __eou__ I like the flowery language, though. I've been enjoying the magical realism of Haruki Murakami lately  __eou__ I'm afraid I've never heard of them. What sort of stories do they write? __eou__ Weird magical realism things. There's a talking cat, so I'm not so sure it's that different than fantasy now that I think about it.  __eou__ If you enjoy a book, who cares about the genre in my opinion. What book would you recommend to start with from Murakami __eou__ Kafka On The Shore is one I really liked. It's all translated from Japanese, but it's a really good book.  __eou__ I'll be sure to check it out, thanks. __eou__ That's great! I've only ever read one book from Stephen King, it was called Lisey's Story and it was super good. I've heard he's a really enjoyable writer as well. __eou__ I've heard the quality of his books varies quite a lot, but there are some gems in there. Its been nice talking to you, thanks for the recommendation.
That's my second favorite color! __eou__ I like azure best, it's cyan and blue mixed. What's your favorite color? __eou__ My favorite color is blue.  Specifically, Carolina blue __eou__ What is Carolina blue? Is Carolina blue a color associated with a sports team? __eou__ It is the official color of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels.  It is a light blue
I got a sudden visit from a friend of mine from another country recently. __eou__ That's great, I hope he enjoy his/her stay __eou__ And, what's good about this is that we will go find some bugs together! I love Fireflies! __eou__ Fireflies are pretty spectacular, and it's refreshing to see someone with a nature focused hobby these days. __eou__ I catch bugs for my collections. It has now become a set of 150!  __eou__ That's impressive! I keep myself busy at the gym, but I'm still cooped up inside all the time. __eou__ That's good to hear. Very few people put efforts towards their health. Did you hire a personal trainer? __eou__ No, I actually get a lot of workout tips from YouTube. You have to take the information with a grain of salt, but there's a lot to be learned there. __eou__ That must save you lot of money from private training sessions. Talking about money, would you be interested in my collection? __eou__ Buying your collection? It would make some interesting and storied decor... __eou__ Of course! Just let me know if you want any butterfly in particular. The pink one I caught yesterday is the biggest of them all! Costed me an accident. __eou__ What kind of accident? Nothing too serious, I hope? __eou__ I broke a few jars while moving this giant one on the shelf. A small cut but I can handle it. More sad about the broken jars. __eou__ Unfortunate, but wounds heal. And, you can replace jars! 
I always bring beer to parties __eou__ Well, you're popular then at least. __eou__ I am at parties I guess.  Just not with my family __eou__ I love to try new foods, so I like going to parties where the host is a good cook __eou__ I love food.  I worked as a cook for a little while.  Just didn't work out though... __eou__ It is a good skill to have! I have a few recipes I consider my "specialties" __eou__ What is your favorite "specialty" to cook? __eou__ I make a really good shrimp scampi pizza __eou__ I used to wait tables at a pizza place.  We didn't have anything that fancy though __eou__ I would want to eat all of the pizza if I worked there. Thankfully I don't work in the food industry __eou__ I've worked in a kinds of restaurants.  I just can't seem to stay at any very long __eou__ I am sorry to hear that. I've learned from my parents that patience is a virtue, but difficult to maintain __eou__ Yeah, I'm not very patient.  One of my many faults I guess... __eou__ Buddhism has a lot of great teachings on patience
How long did it take to get that done? __eou__ The program has sixty credits and most masters programs only require about half that. __eou__ That's pretty near. I should get my own masters, but in law. I want to fight evil __eou__ A masters in law sounds difficult. __eou__ It probably is, but I just went through the worst breakup! I can handle anything, right? __eou__ Well, the course load would certainly take your mind off things! __eou__ Oh, that is a very good point! Now, to get a loan...Have you found work in your field already? __eou__ That's the good thing about a business masters - it can be used in almost any field. __eou__ I can imagine, do you have any preference? Please don't work for some giant evil corporation. __eou__ No way. I have ethics and morals. I prefer corporations with a "soul." __eou__ Phew, I'm so happy to hear that. I have you land a job in your field soon! __eou__ Me, too, although once I'm working I won't be able to travel much. __eou__ That is a bummer for sure, but you'll get time off from time to time! Where will you travel? __eou__ Somewhere far away like Japan, but I like to keep my stay short because I get homesick sometimes.
I wish it was Fall already. __eou__ too hot outside? __eou__ Yeah, I'm not a fan of hot weather. __eou__ Same. It's too hot here. __eou__ Autumn can't come soon enough! I especially can't wait for Halloween. __eou__ Halloween is definitely my favorite. I love to dress my cat up. __eou__ My dog would literally never allow me to dress him. He's a maverick! __eou__ I'm sorry, that really stinks. It's so fun dressing up animals. What do you try to dress him up as? __eou__ Never costumes, because he went crazy when I tried to put a sweater on him. Don't be sorry. It's very funny and just part of his character. __eou__ I understand! I dress Mater up as characters from Cars. It's my favorite movie, has been since I was a kid. __eou__ Is that where the cat's name came from, too? __eou__ Yep! Mater is my second favorite character, and given that the cat looks like Larry the Cable Guy, it kinda fit. __eou__ That sounds hilarious. I've never seen Cars, for some reason or another. __eou__ Oh, you should. I hated it at first, but my children loved it, and then it grew on me. really good story, honestly. One of Pixar's best.
My manager keep lying to me. He is trying to advantage of me. __eou__ Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar? __eou__ I do but I have a great job and I dont want to lose it and affect my family __eou__ Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings. If moral gets too low it's not good for anybody. __eou__ I guess so.  I am just such a upbeat person usually.  I don't like conflict.   __eou__ I understand. Conflict can be difficult, but a respectful discussion could be had __eou__ I guess that's true.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the situation and we can just have a good laugh about it __eou__ That is possible! Try to approach it respectfully but almost casually. __eou__ That's great advice!  Have you ever had to deal with a situation like this? __eou__ I have, both at work and at home. I am the oldest of five! __eou__ Wow!  I'm an only child.  But my husband has 11 siblings! __eou__ Wow! That is a lot of siblings __eou__ It certainly is!  Unfortunately he never gets to see them because of his job __eou__ That is difficult. Maybe they can use technology more to keep in touch, video calls and such
My girlfriend is going to work overseas. We've never been apart for more than a couple of days. __eou__ What do you plan on doing while you're alone? __eou__ I plan on hopefully getting some writing done for a personal project I've put aside - anything to distract myself for a bit with my girlfriend being away __eou__ Speaking of projects, I'm tired of of working all day sitting at home. All because of this broken leg of mine! __eou__ Ah I'm so sorry to hear that! How did you break your leg? __eou__ mountain biking accident . its the 2nd time i broke it in the same place . __eou__ Ouch! I'm not much of an outdoors person myself maybe that's why I haven't broken any bones yet..Any idea how long your recovery is supposed to be? __eou__ The doc says it gonna take me another 8 weeks for recovery. You can't just stop yourself from going out when you experience enough thrill! __eou__ Aw thats a long time I'm sorry, but hopefully you're getting some well deserved rest now. Is your job flexible with you working from home?
Took the trash out yesterday and it burst all over the ground. I was pretty peeved. __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that.  It will get better. __eou__ Yeah, I hope so. This week has gone on too long already. __eou__ i understand that feeling well . i usually try to distract myself with some other activity , like recycling . __eou__ Yeah. I crochet from time to time, but it's hard to find the time anymore sadly.  __eou__ Crocheting is fun.  The name derives from French.  My sister enjoys doing it, what else takes up your time or just that __eou__ Mostly it's just that. I have to work a lot during the week, and am even on call too, depending. __eou__ Do you find it difficult doing stuff early a times? __eou__ Yeah. I sleep whenever I can, since I could be woken up at any time of the night, so I usually don't get up early. __eou__ Do you think you'll have trouble getting up early when you find a new job? Back to regular wake times and all? __eou__ It'll be weird adjusting if I get a new job, but I do think it'd be better in the long run. Less stress, less depression for sure. __eou__ you know, some stress can be healthy and good for you. how u dealing with the depression? __eou__ Yeah, but it's super stressful when planning funerals... For depression, I mainly use therapy. have to, in this line of work __eou__ do you ever feel like therapy doesn't do anything ?like idk sometimes i wonder if it really helps __eou__ It definitely has helped me cope with my job, which is good. Otherwise, I'd've burnt out a long time ago.
Me too. It's the only time I have silence in the house. I usually will sew late at night. What do you do? __eou__ I work the night shift at the cemetery. __eou__ I prefer night over day time because its real quiet inside the home & no sounds of any kind. very relaxing, and you? __eou__ Same, I feel I get my best work done in the night, the lack of distractions really helps me focus. __eou__ same here, I seem to focus better and think better as well, its when I get most of my work done. __eou__ My family is back in the states, so there is no reason for me to be and about during the day. It helps with timezones too __eou__ I sometimes stay up late just to talk with a sister from California. No distractions. __eou__ Yeah, if they are also a night owl or they are in a different timezone you can get some really great conversations in at night __eou__ Very true, and yes my sister is a night owl as well. we talk for hours, and its so quiet. __eou__ Yeah, does you job accommodate your night owling? I'm lucky mine does __eou__ Well it was very nice chatting, have a great evening from one night owl to another :) __eou__ Fun indeed, enjoy! __eou__ w __eou__ Good night!
My aunt just call to tall me that she will be visiting next week. __eou__ I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close? __eou__ Not really.  We were when I was younger.  I just don't know how she'll feel about my dogs __eou__ Why did you two grow apart? I bet she will like your dogs. I mean c'mon, who doesn't love dogs?! __eou__ Life just gets crazy I guess.  My dad's whole side of the family grew apart over the years __eou__ Ah, life does get crazy. My family only gets together around the holidays. __eou__ At least you get to see them occasionally!  Do you all have any special traditions? __eou__ That is truth! This year will be quite hard, though. My father was killed in a shootout, he was a cop. It won't be the same. __eou__ Oh my gosh!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Death is always hard to handle, especially around the holidays __eou__ Thank you for you understanding. You are kind. So, does your family not gather at the holidays? __eou__ Not really.  Most of them live too far away and can't afford to travel every year __eou__ That is quite sad. I wish you could see them. I've learned how important it is to cherish family while you have them. __eou__ That's true.  Maybe I could offer to drive to them this year __eou__ If you can afford to do it, I would totally recommend it. It could be an adventure too!
Interesting. What does a cabana boy do, exactly? __eou__ I will be offering towels to people at the beach, I will be operating from a cabaña.  __eou__ Great! Is there any charge for the towels? __eou__ It's a private beach, so I get paid by the owner, and tips. __eou__ Awesome, here you go. Any site seeing suggestions? I would love to see the city a little. __eou__ Definitely check out the private beaches. Theyre the best in the area.  __eou__ I hope I don't get bored of the beach! __eou__ Oh, you definitely won't. You can snorkle, get your divers license, etc. And, if you do, there's still the night clubs. They're world famous __eou__ The night club sounds like a perfect way to kick off the night! __eou__ More like the perfect way to end it! Locals don't start getting there until midnight or later. Usually when all the Americans start to leave. __eou__ What's the best way to not stand out as an American? __eou__ Do what the locals do. Eat dinner at 10ish, go out to the nightclubs later. Don't leave until they close around 4 or 5 __eou__ I'll have to keep that in mind. I don't usually stay up late but when in Rome right? __eou__ In Spain, in this case!
i'm doing good and u __eou__ i'm doing well . playing a game of pool with my friends __eou__ oooo you winning? how many  __eou__ Yes, I am winning. Four of us playing, two teams __eou__ nicee i never could get the hang of pool my hands sweat like crazy lol but i do love to cook with freinds  __eou__ That sounds fun. What do you like to cook most __eou__ honestly curry chicken or califlower but i cooked some quish(idk how to spell) and it was sooo good __eou__ Sounds really good. I have not tried curry chicken before __eou__ oh your missing out its so good but getting the chicken to that perfect bone falling off is a bit tricky sometimes btw whats your fav color __eou__ I see. My favorite color is probably sparkly white, like a unicorn horn __eou__ mines blue but now im thinking of unicorns  __eou__ I love unicorns! __eou__ if only they were real sigh __eou__ Indeed. Horses are the next best thing though
when i was younger i did __eou__ any reason you don't do it anymore ? __eou__ I don't know, meat just stopped doing it for me, I much prefer to each fish these days, I haven't looked back __eou__ It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian? __eou__ I've thought about it, and i usually have some veggies with my fish. But I just can't stop eating our scaly friends # __eou__ I couldn't disagree with how much they help with our eyes and hair growth. My mom used to tell me to thank fishes for giving me blue eyes haha! __eou__ Yeah, my eyesight is great. It could just be placebo, but I feel it's gotten even better since I started eating more fish.  __eou__ You will get even better with time. Keep eating fish and who knows your eyes can be like mine someday! __eou__ I can only hope, do you eat carrots as well. I hear they are good for the eyes, but I don't eat them much myself __eou__ I thought they make you a horse! Just kidding, IMO spinach is better option. __eou__ Ah, well I'll give it a go, thanks for the great advice! __eou__ I would suggest buying it straight from a farm rather than stores. It looses its value quickly. Eat fresh, live long my friend! __eou__ Sounds like you know a lot about the subject, I'm a strapped for cash, so sometimes its difficult to get the best quality stuff from stores. __eou__ Of course! My dad owns a small farm where we have fun with animals and sometimes play basketball with our neighbourhood orphanage.
Fantastic, so what languages do you translate? __eou__ I use the website interface google translate enxtension to try to learn spanish. What about you? __eou__ I'm using it to learn English. __eou__ That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn what was your original language  __eou__ Yeah, the spelling of English is odd. I speak French natively. __eou__ I took French in school too! Totally useless now i mean it does help with spanish but ive pretty much forgot 90% of it . __eou__ Well, if you ever need help I can offer it. Why do you want to learn Spanish? __eou__ spanish is actually a strong suit of mine but i honestly want to be a author  __eou__ oh? Writing in Spanish, or bilingually? __eou__ I only speak English, so I am not a polyglot..someone who can speak sever languages, that would be awesome __eou__ You can definitely do it, I'm sure. Especially if you work more with Google Translate __eou__ You should trying using google translate to translate english text to a target language like french. __eou__ I definitely use it a lot to check things when I'm using English. Most of these messages have been run through to check it even. __eou__ thats so smart go you, so why do u want to learn english again 
I like pizza with meat  __eou__ The term "pizz" started in the 10th century in a Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio. __eou__ Wow, that's interesting.  Are you a big fan of trivia? __eou__ Sure, especially if it includes sports. I play football and baseball. It would be my forte. __eou__ I love sports trivia!  My dad and I used to do it together before he started working so much __eou__ Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Life has a way of getting in the way, huh? __eou__ Yeah, he's an investment banker.  He started working for Stifel a few years ago and they work him into the ground __eou__ Wall Street never sleeps. Does he ever get time off? __eou__ He is supposed to but his requests never get approved. __eou__ That is terrible! Why won't he try to find a new job? __eou__ He makes too much money at this job.  He's paying for my college so I guess I can't complain __eou__ I understand. Maybe, at least, with such a well-paying job he could afford to eventually take a year off or at least retire early. __eou__ That would be nice for him.  What do you do for work? __eou__ Well, I'm a college football player so I do that, attend school, and enjoy pizza whenever I possibly can. I like pizza a lot

Pizza is another favorite food, so many different choices __eou__ Yeah, my kids love pizza, I like to make it myself rather than order it, at least then I can save some money  __eou__ That is a good idea. I make shrimp scampi pizza and it is so good. Never seen it in a restaurant though __eou__ I love scampi, I live in New York so its certainly not traditional to put on pizza around here, I might give it a try. Sounds Delicious! __eou__ Try it! The trick is to thicken the sauce that you cook the shrimp in (with flour) and then spread on the dough __eou__ Interesting, is it just a normal tomato sauce you cook them in, or is it something else? __eou__ No, just butter and some lemon juice __eou__ Interesting, is this a recipe from your grandmother, or is it something you got from elsewhere?  __eou__ My grandmother used to cook shrimp for me and put it on toast, so I adapted it from that __eou__ Sounds lovely, I wish I had some tips that I could give you in return. __eou__ No worries, with technology, new recipes are a click away __eou__ For sure, thanks for chatting

Did you ski or sled? Sledding is a whoooooole different animal there! __eou__ Just ski. It's really easy to take a weekend and go to my family's cabin near the resorts and use their slopes. __eou__ That must be nice! and here I am too tired to go to long vacations. Is it risky though, skeeing? __eou__ no, it's not that risky if you know what you're doing. I've done it since birth...Comes with living here, I guess __eou__ You sure know a lot of things about it then. Have you encounter any bear yet, in the mountains? __eou__ No, sadly.

Me too!  What brand do you use? __eou__ just an ordinary pocket knife nothing fancy.  What do you use __eou__ I have this great Bear Grills knife, perfect for all sorts of woodworking. __eou__ Smart idea. They have thick handles which makes them easier to grip for long periods of time. __eou__ That's true! For example, while watching a movie, I find it relaxing to whittle. I've watched Good Burger so many times now. __eou__ That is so funny! __eou__ What do you like to do while you work wood? __eou__ i just work on my wood work and make couches and stuff __eou__ Oh, that's interesting!

It used to be all over the radio. __eou__ Yes, he was the best musician ever. __eou__ I dunno. If you're hearing it in a cab all day, he gets kinda old quick. __eou__ Well anything on repeat gets old fast no matter where you are :) __eou__ Yeah. And that's the problem with radio stations! __eou__ Yea. Like what is the point of listening to the radio, if they're going to play the same song. I can do that on my own without the ads. __eou__ Sadly, we're not allowed to use Spotify or Pandora at our jobs... __eou__ Thats a bummer.  Wouldn't it be nice to just quit your job? __eou__ Absolutely. I'm slowly taking online classes in hopes of doing that. __eou__ Online classes takes some dedication versus going to class. Good for you! __eou__ Yeah, but they work around my schedule much better. I can work during the day, do them at night. __eou__ What kind of classes have you taken?
I returned home from school one afternoon to news that my dog was run over by a car. __eou__ I'm so sorry! You must've been so sad.

She's very talented. I'd love to see her live. __eou__ Wait, you've never seen your mom play live and she's a pianist? __eou__ No, I have been so busy with school work, and she wants me to focus on that.  That's why I graduated top in my class. __eou__ That's impressive. So I guess one could say your family is really focused on personal accomplishments. __eou__ YEah that's true.

Everyone wants something from me, who should I try to please? __eou__ Do what makes you happy __eou__ And what if that angers mom and dad? Sometimes I wish I didn't have to wake up in the morning... __eou__ That is not a way to think about things, besides you can't please everyone __eou__ You sound just like my therapist, who never understands me. __eou__ Have you ever thought about getting a dog?

There are plenty of them in there! __eou__ Are you a Buddhist? __eou__ No I am not.  Why do you ask?
Well I do like rock music, so it seems like a good fit. When did they first form? __eou__ They started in 1990, the year I was born, as a matter of fact! They kind of started with a heavy metal sound with the first studio album they made, "Undertow." But then they got really dominant during the alternative metal movement, especially with their second album in 1996, "Ænima." __eou__ I was born in 87. I loved the alternative metal movement in the mid 90's.  __eou__ what a coincidence , i love rock music ! __eou__ 80's rock is my personal favorite, but Tool was definitely one of my favorites of the 90's __eou__ They were really influential. I always considered them having more to do with the punk scene, though. Haven't really gotten very dep into their evolution, I have to admit. __eou__ I think in the early 90's everybody tried to slip into the Punk scene. From 95 or 96 on they were really heavy __eou__ Yeah.  I started to get annoyed with some of it because many tried too hard. __eou__ Yea. I went with my older brother to a concert in 97. We were the only olive skinned people there haha __eou__ I bet!  Times have changed a lot, especially with music. __eou__ Yea. I still like heavy stuff. Nobody expects it because i'm kinda nerdy __eou__ Haha yeah.  I'm not sure why people don't expect that.  I wasn't a nerd myself in school, but I knoew many who liked metal. __eou__ I wanna be a librarian. Most people expect me to like classical stuff __eou__ Yes!  That means there is some good balance going on there!

What's your favorite blues artist? __eou__ I love Eric Clapton and B.B. King. I've gotten into nightcore recently with some remixes: is that like Japanese techno? __eou__ I like B.B. King too! I think it is similar. I am still learning about this music! __eou__ I like, "The Thrill Is Gone" by B.B. King but he has made other great songs too.  __eou__ That's a great one. I also like "Let the Good Times Roll." How did you get into blues music? __eou__ My mother: it's still her favorite type of music.

i compete playing violin on competitions , a few of them i've placed high in . __eou__ i like dogs but my real passion lies in politics . __eou__ What type of dogs do you like? __eou__ I like golden retrievers, poodles, and Yorkies. __eou__ Cool!  Do you own one?  I've a pomeranian.  __eou__ I have a Yorkie. __eou__ That's nice!  How do yorkies handle kids? __eou__ Pretty good, as long as the kid and the dog are both well trained! __eou__ Ha!  Kids are harder to train sometimes! __eou__ That's so true. I love to take my dog running, do you run at all? __eou__ I run some.  I prefer hiking though.  I think a snail runs faster than I do __eou__ Hey hiking is great too. Are you into politics at all? That's my true passion. __eou__ I follow them, and vote, but not a true passion.

But if I had the issue I would leave it to them. __eou__ what issue do you mean?  __eou__ foot odor
Yeah, i bet! I feel like abstract compositions actually take a lot of thought and time. __eou__ You could even argue that writers are artists too but they are up for just as much criticism as other artists. __eou__ True, in some ways a writer has to be more creative in order to sell to the public. __eou__ Writers have to develop long term characters, not just one piece. It's got to be difficult __eou__ Both have to create meaning behind their work. An Artist has to not onloy produce a piece with meaning but find an audience that understands the meaning. __eou__ Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be an artist. It just seems so hard __eou__ I imagine it could be liberating also. Working when it suits you. __eou__ It would I'm sure. But I already wish I made more money...I couldn't be a "starving artist" __eou__ Art majors have a hard time finding work. __eou__ Yea. I just don't think I'm brave enough __eou__ I don't understand why colleges continue to offer such programs. __eou__ Me neither. There's absolutely no job market __eou__ Yet they tell students that there are jobs. __eou__ I guess it depends on what you're willing to sacrifice to be able to work.
I was once walking through a forest __eou__ That sounds really pleasant. What kind of forest was it? __eou__ It was part of the Catskills: have you been there before? __eou__ I have!

I love getting travel recommendations. What else did you do while you were out there? __eou__ I also visited Albany New York for the first time: I've lived in the southeast most of my life.  __eou__ That's so cool! That is right where I grew up. I am a big Albany sports fan lol. What made Albany different from the Southeast? __eou__ The nightlife and the attractions! I also loved the various restaurants. Where I grew up it's country land and quiet.  __eou__ Albany does have some great restaurants. They're surprisingly diverse. My favorite is Bombers Burritos. I would like to visit the country sometime __eou__ If you get to Memphis Tennessee, close to where I used to live, there's plenty of BBQ restaurants.  __eou__ Yum! I love BBQ. Brisket is my favorite. What is your go-to dish? __eou__ My favorite restaurant: the Blues City Cafe has the best BBQ ribs I've ever had! So I guess ribs would be mine.  __eou__ Good choice. Ribs are too messy for me; I get jealous of people who can eat them without getting sauce everywhere!

It's amazing, you've got to try it! __eou__ Sounds like a great idea. Ever used nutritional yeast? __eou__ Yeah, I love it!

It has become more popular. __eou__ I listened to a podcast about this very thing recently. It started to pick up when the US hosted the 1994 World Cup.. __eou__ That sounds about right. I was excited to watch the Women's teams this year. __eou__ Me too! unfortunatley the rules governing highschool soccer are holding us players back from being as good as they are in Europe, where they play club soccer year round. __eou__ I didn't know the rules were different. That's not fair! Players should not be held back from their sport. __eou__ Yeah, the HS rules keep players from being able to play year round. But one day we will be as good as they are, I know.

My younger sister is getting married before I am, I can't believe it. __eou__ Do you feel negative about it, or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes, I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child, so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it, hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity. __eou__ I'm just having a hard time believing it. I feel like the outcast since I wear all black and listen to rock music. __eou__ Aww, there's someone out there for you too!

It's sad how common suicide really is. I was really upset about Chris Cornell too __eou__ It's horrible how it seems to be a growing epidemic.  __eou__ I agree. I hope we can find a way to help everyone who struggles __eou__ I think that music helps people a lot, so it's hard when someone who helped a lot of people, like Chris Cornell, dies. 
that's enjoyable . i'm a red cross volunteer when i've time on the weekend . __eou__ that is nice , i do like the drums also __eou__ Do you happen to play any other instruments? __eou__ yes, I'm a guitar player __eou__ I've always wanted to play the guitar. I'm a highschool band teacher and I play the sax. __eou__ How do you feel towards the saxophone? __eou__ The instrument itself can sound very good and put you in the mood like jazz and at the same time it can be funny. __eou__ I really do enjoy Jazz occasionally. __eou__ Do you have any hobbies that you do weekly? __eou__ I do have activities I do for enjoyment. My favorite is golf. __eou__ My favorite activity is yoga since I can stretch myself and be relaxed. __eou__ Yoga is great, awesome for the spirit, your health, and mental peace. __eou__ We should meet up one day so we can do yoga together then! __eou__ yes , that would be quite wonderful !
I feel like they all just give the same answers to get money. __eou__ I am so sorry you are feeling that way, have you tried any prescribed medications yet? __eou__ No, I do not like to take any medications. __eou__ Sometimes medication can work but you have to be careful because some side effects of drugs can affect physical diseases. __eou__ Yes, I have heard of that and it bothers me. __eou__ there are a variety of medications available to ease your suffering . __eou__ I would want to research any that are advised as I am a very healthy person. __eou__ I really understand your concern. __eou__ Do you agree that exercise can help when having problems? __eou__ Yes.

Hi, my wife took me paragliding yesterday! __eou__ Wow, where did you do that? __eou__ I drove my ford truck all the way to the Appalachian mountains  __eou__ That sounds amazing. The appalachian mountains are a place that i would like to go and paint. __eou__ I am going there to go camping next week.  It should be a fun time. __eou__ I camp alot. I take my watercolours with me and paint all the beautiful things I see. Where else do you camp? __eou__ I have been to many places to camp, but usually just the mountains.  I have been camping in the mountains with all 3 of my wives. __eou__ The mountains are such a beautiful place to camp. I love the blue of the sky above the mountains, it is my favourite colour. __eou__ Yes it can be quite pretty.  I like the orange sky of the sunset more. __eou__ Sunset is a gorgeous combinations of colours. The oranges, blues, purples, reds and yellows are mind-blowing sometimes.
I agree, to a certain extent.  The first 4-5 days I was enjoying it, but then I became lonely and felt housebound.  Went out on silly errands just to be around people. __eou__ That reminds me of Bobby Fischer having to go out for walks after spending days in his room studying chess __eou__ I just read Catcher In the Rye.  Ever heard of it? __eou__ I have! It is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell __eou__ Oh no silly.  You are thinking of 1984.  Catcher in the Rye is by JD Salinger.  Sound familair? __eou__ ohhh youre right, that's the one about the guy who appreciates solitude. I read it in highschool __eou__ Now you got it.  Have you read any other good books lately? __eou__ yes I have __eou__ Oh please do tell.  What was a name of one? __eou__ I did read george orwells 1984, what a disturbing yet interesting read __eou__ oh yes.  I just saw that movie too.  Imagine living in a world like that.  Oh the humaity!!! __eou__ I never saw the movie - was it true to the book? __eou__ pretty close.  Its not as good though __eou__ well its hard to fit so much content into a movie. Would you recommend it? __eou__ nice talking to you
I am interested in the lifestyle.  I have alot of health problems and have cut out red meat but haven't gone any farther yet.  do you recommend it? __eou__ I would recommend vegetarianism. For me it is more about how animals are treated. I do not like how our food is processed. So i went vegan. i do love steak though. __eou__ How are you able to resist steak if you love it so much? __eou__ Well, there are a lot of tasty steak alternatives, like tempeh and grain-based veggie meats __eou__ I have always been curious about those. Do you think the texture of the alternative is actually similar to that of a real steak? __eou__ It's not exactly the same, but some of the newer brands are getting pretty close. What do you like to eat? __eou__ Everything, pretty much. I love animals in general, but I also love food, so it's pretty difficult. Fruit is my favorite snack. __eou__ I understand the dilemma! Fruit i a great snack, though. The guy who plays guitar in a band I'm in is obsessed with pomegranate __eou__ Pomegranate is awesome! People ask me if I'm in a band all the time, probably because I have tattoo sleeves. I play piano, but not very well. :P  __eou__ Oh wow, really?  You're not thinking of travaling to Japan are you?  They might mistake you for a yakuza.  Yakuza have sleeve tattoos as well. __eou__ I've never heard of yakuza, but I will definitely look them up and see! I would love to go to Japan one day, though. Such a beautiful and exciting country. __eou__ Same here! I've actually never been to another country, but I'd love to visit Japan or Africa one day. __eou__ Same here, I also think Spain would be interesting to visit. Language barriers would be terrifying though. __eou__ Yeah, they would! I only took a year of Spanish in college and never got very far. Do you speak any other languages?

What's your favorite book or author? __eou__ I like Stephen King and classics. __eou__ I have listened to a lot of Stephen King. It is fun to get into a story since I'm not able to go out of the house. __eou__ He definitely has an imagination. __eou__ Are you working today? I have to take a break for a few days due to some health problems. __eou__ I am working today, Monday morning, the start of a new week. __eou__ Since I work from home, I make my own hours most of the time. Sometimes I work all weekend. It depends how I feel. __eou__ That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work? __eou__ The work is a little monotonous, but I am glad I am able to continue to work from home despite being bed ridden. __eou__ That is a major advantage of working from home. __eou__ Do you have to commute to work? The traffic in my city is terrible, so that's another perk of working at home. __eou__ Yes I have to commute and it is terrible.
i've an older sister and a younger sister , we listen to all kinds of music __eou__ i've no siblings and i live in apartment __eou__ Being the middle child has its advantages and disadvantages __eou__ I guess I missed out on all that haha __eou__ My siblings usually like to eat all of my sweets __eou__ Maybe you should hide them __eou__ I have tried to but they always find them __eou__ Have you tried talking to your parents about the problem? __eou__ Yes, they just find it funny __eou__ Maybe ask them for more money to buy more sweets then you can get some more or they will stop your siblings from eating the original sweets __eou__ In order for my parents to give me money, I have to do chores around the house. __eou__ Get your siblings to help you and then make a deal that they get some of the sweets that way they don't have to steal yours __eou__ I have tried that, but they just take whatever they want. __eou__ Sounds like you have some terrible siblings
I love to sing as well, but sadly no else loves or even wants to hear me sing. __eou__ It can be done with our without music and instruments. Have you tried Youtube? __eou__ No way! I wouldn't record myself __eou__ that would be good to do . you should try to look it up on youtube __eou__ Maybe, I don't know though. The internet can be a cruel place __eou__ yeah but there are a lot of programs that help! __eou__ Do you know any? __eou__ There's websites like skillshare that can help you. I could also help you if you would like! __eou__ That's okay. Maybe I'll check that one out later __eou__ well , keep singing and best of luck ! __eou__ Thank you! Who knows, maybe I'll actually get somewhere __eou__ you will ! as long as you work hard at it , you will get there ! That's what I did! __eou__ It worked out for you? __eou__ It did! That's the first thing that came to mind right before pulling it; 
It was pretty shocking for me to learn that I have failed my Calculus exam when I had studied so hard for it __eou__ Ahhh.  Math.  I have certainly been there before.  I am so sorry!  Is there any way to retake it? __eou__ I have to go in early and take it again, but I only get one chance. I got lucky she said I could retake it. __eou__ I hope it goes better this time. Math is definitely not my favorite subject. I would rather be mushroom hunting with my paps. __eou__ Mushroom hunting? That sounds interesting. What exactly is it? __eou__ There is a specific kind I like to look for, and pick. They are really nice when you fry them up. Do you have any hobbies? __eou__ That is really interesting. Fried mushrooms are really good. I enjoy listening to and reviewing rock music.  __eou__ That sounds really cool. Do you have any favorite rock musicians __eou__ My favorite rock band is Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Page is the best guitarist ever. Do you like any music? __eou__ I am a huge fan of rock myself. Actually, Zeppelin is my favorite band also. It's tough to beat Robert Plant on vocals __eou__ NICE! Robert Plant's vocals are amazing! What is your favorite Zeppelin song? __eou__ That's a tough one. I think I would choose Kashmir though. How about yours? __eou__ Kashmir is amazing. Mine always changes based off my mood. Right now my favorite is Going to California. __eou__ Another great, classic. They have so many great songs. Not a single bad one in my opinion.
It was! Some of my favorite songs was Come Together and Hey Jude!  __eou__ They are great songs. Hey Jude was originally called Hey Jules. McCartney wrote it for John Lennon's son Julian during Julian's parents' divorce. __eou__ Wow.  I didn't know that.  Do you know a lot about music history? __eou__ I actually took a couple courses of music history in college. __eou__ Interesting.

Someone asked me for some money to donate to their charity and I told them no. I feel so terrible but I have such a low income that I have to think about my family. __eou__ I totally understand that. Sometimes the most important charity is your own. __eou__ It's also hard with my allowance. I'm only ten years old __eou__ At 10 you shouldn't have to donate to charity, I'm already in university (UMass) studying Philosophy, and money is tight for me too. __eou__ It was for one of my friends. I have a lot of friends __eou__ You are lucky that you have alot of friends. I don't have time for friends right now, but maybe later. __eou__ What is philosophy? __eou__ It is kindof studying and thinking about life and why it is the way it is. Confusing I know. __eou__ I don't get it. But I also don't get math  __eou__ Math is hard for me too, that's why I'm not studying it in Uni. What do you like in school? __eou__ I like to read a lot.

I hope that they have good insurance __eou__ I'm not sure if she does, but gosh do I wish people were better drivers. People seemed to be a lot more apt at driving in the UK than here. __eou__ I haven't been driving for long enough to tell, but I'm sure you're right. Is your mom hurt though? __eou__ Oh yeah, she's fine. It was just a fender bender. You'll see in time, I'm sure. How long have you been driving? __eou__ I'm really happy to hear she is alright. Only for a few months! Finally passed my driving exams. __eou__ Oh wow! Have any crazy scenarios happen to you yet?

How do these people get their licences? Heck, maybe *she* was from the UK! __eou__ Ha, I wouldn't be surprised if she was! I actually have it on dash cam. Are you coming over this weekend? I'll show you! __eou__ Oh wow, good thing! You should think about reporting them then. Did we make plans? I totally forgot  __eou__ Like to the police? No worries, I'll give you a call later to make plans __eou__ Yeah absolutely, that kind of reckless driving shouldn't go unwarned.  __eou__ Ok, I'll be sure to head to the police station with a copy of the video tonight. Cops intimidate me though haha
I had planned to get my wife flowers for her birthday but I completly forgot. I feel very upset about having forgotten and think she'll hate me. __eou__ Is there still time to get one? You can if you hurry! __eou__ Her birthday was yesterday and I was too busy with work. She was upset that I forgot her birthday. __eou__ Well you can always get more flowers, so it'll be okay! Try making it up by bringing her food! __eou__ I have a dinner date at a fancy place she loves planned tonight. So I hope it goes well. How are you? __eou__ its going okay. I have a few dates a month. trying to take it slow to be honest. No one seems different though. __eou__ Well keep at it. You will find someone for you. What are your hobbies? __eou__ I love acting. It's always been my dream to play the big roles in films. __eou__ That is really cool! What is your favorite type of acting? __eou__ I usually like fantasy movies.  You know I get enough of the real world, so I'd like to see something fantastical to dive into people's imaginations. __eou__ I agree 100% with that. Escaping from the real world is always nice. What do you like to eat? __eou__ mac and cheese ! especially in the shape of dinosaurs . __eou__ Aw. That is cute. I like eating meat. Steak is my favorite. Do you like steak? __eou__ I do, but I would rather eat other stuff now. Steak without qualification is considered beefsteak!
i love sports than reading , are you into sports ? __eou__ not too much , what sports ? __eou__ Football mainly. __eou__ football is nice . i am more of a reader than a sports person __eou__ Me too actually.  __eou__ What sort of things do you enjoy reading? __eou__ Stories about near death experiences.  __eou__ That is pretty scary, is it life reaffirming for you? __eou__ Yes indeed.  __eou__ I enjoy fantasy myself, takes me to wild places. __eou__ Well this stuff really happened though.  __eou__ Yeah I don't like to read about real life, I already live in real life! __eou__ That's a good point.  __eou__ I'm glad you do though, people like being heard!
My sister and her husband are both hoarders of things.  they love to buy in bulk and just continue to keep everything they buy therefore their house is full of stuff __eou__ That kind of behavior has been associated with health risks , economic burdens, and adverse affects on loved ones. It's unfortunate. __eou__ Maybe one day I will move to London.  __eou__ Wouldn't that be great. Think of all the changes we could make. __eou__ Yep. And the soccor! __eou__ I guess you'll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha. __eou__ Just furniture probably.  __eou__ I live with my mom. If we moved, I would have to deal with her 500 pairs of shoes. She's a hoarder for sure. __eou__ OH wow that's a lot of shoes.  __eou__ 500 pairs of shoes is definitely way too many.  If she was unwilling to discard the items and the shoes were covering up living areas, I would hate it. __eou__ I agree. __eou__ I have to be careful travelling to new countries though. I am allergic to shellfish and cats. __eou__ There are cats everywhere.  __eou__ Oh wow. I would have to avoid them. Do you have pets?
yes i have __eou__ Its more conscious and emotional feelings. When you are identify that in you __eou__ I just wish I could have gone farther in archery, you know? __eou__ You can learn eventually. How come you stopped? __eou__ Kids are expensive. __eou__ I don't have any myself, but I can only imagine. How many kids do you have? __eou__ Just a daughter. I must admit, I spoil her. __eou__ That's fantastic. Do you plan on having more kids eventually? Nothing wrong with spoiling. __eou__ I would love to have more kids, actually. What about you? Any plans of having children? __eou__ I would love to one day. My girlfriend wants 5, but i'm thinking that's too many personally. lol  __eou__ Oh my gosh, that would be a lot of work! I don't think I could have that many, personally, but to each their own! __eou__ I think two is the perfect number. I grew up with one brother, and that worked out well I think. haha. How many would you like to have? __eou__ Not sure, honestly. I grew up with two sisters and a brother, and I thought that was a good number as well. Maybe I'm partial because I'm number 3. __eou__ They say the third time is the charm. You must be the favorite child __eou__ Definitely ;)
i've never been there but would love to go too __eou__ i know what other places would you like to visit ? __eou__ I have heard they have a big swimming pool there. __eou__ Really? How big is it? __eou__ I think they used it in the Olympics so it must be pretty big! __eou__ Wow! I love to run but have never been very good at swimming, I would like to get better. __eou__ It takes a lot of practice, I love swimming. How often do you run? __eou__ Every day, its an important part ofmy routine. Do you run? __eou__ I have done in the past but have fallen out of the habit. I should really start again. __eou__ You should, it feels great and is amazing for your health __eou__ We moved when my parents split up and I haven't looked for routes around my new house. Maybe I'll go for a run tomorrow morning! __eou__ I think that's a great idea!Make sure you stretch first! __eou__ Haha yeah, don't want to get injured on my first run! __eou__ Yeah, you probably better. And just start slow on the small hills.
my wife is amazing, shes the only one i want __eou__ Sounds like you lucked out, make sure she knows how special she is :) __eou__ I always try my best. __eou__ That is sweet! __eou__ Yeah, being comfortable around another person is so relaxing. __eou__ It is! Do you have children? __eou__ Yes, I have two children 8 and 10. __eou__ Oh wonderful! Boys or Girls?
I have a toothache today but no time to get to the dentist.  __eou__ I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any meds that could help relieve the pain? __eou__ I have picked up a few, I'm just hoping they start working soon. __eou__ what kind of meds? something like xanax? __eou__ Just general painkillers, mainly ibuprofen for now. It should help numb the pain until I can schedule a dentist appointment. __eou__ that should work.  I never go to the dentist because I am afraid to talk to them. __eou__ What do you find fearful about dentists? __eou__ I don't find dentists scary specifically, I find everyone scary because I have autism   __eou__ Ah, that's fair, I assure you people are not as bad as they seem, I've never personally ran into an issue with any medical staff before. __eou__ Yes I am sure it would be fine, I just find them intimidating  __eou__ Everyone gets a bit worried when talking to certain people, a smile can usually go a long way though.
yes , i can make you a meal with my fresh vegetables ! __eou__ i love to cook . . . i lately discovered costco to shop at . . . love it __eou__ How long have you been cooking? __eou__ It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started. __eou__ Interesting...what inspired you to start cooking __eou__ I started as a way to keep in shape, especially since it requires a lot of strength, endurance, and flexibility. __eou__ Yes it does. I have slowed down over the years but I still cherish my fresh vegetables. __eou__ What meats and vegetables do you like? __eou__ I love brocolli, carrots, chicken, and fish. What about you? __eou__ Yeah, broccoli is the best vegetable. I really love to eat it raw as well. __eou__ Me too!... dip it in ranch and enjoy! __eou__ I love ranch dressing too. It is my favorite to dip with. It has been the best selling salad dressing in the US since 1992. __eou__ That's an interesting fact. I wonder what people used before ranch became so popular... __eou__ probably something bland __eou__ I agree. I can't imagine raw broccolli without ranch
Oh really? what kind of effects does it have? I am all for benefits! __eou__ It is especially good for people with high blood pressure __eou__ That's great, I should mention that when selling mine at the market __eou__ Yes, beetroot has many benefits, I juice mine with apples and carrots daily and love it! __eou__ That sounds really good. Do you ever add any spices or anything? __eou__ Not really mostly lemons, kale or greens of some kind. __eou__ I could never put kale in it, but I'd like to try adding lemons __eou__ You really can't taste the kale, as the kale has calcium and great benefits as well as the beetroot. __eou__ No kale for me, but if you enjoy it that's great! __eou__ lol, to each there own I have heard beetroot is good for the kidneys? __eou__ Yeah, probably helps circulation quite a bit.  __eou__ I bet, I know when cutting it up it can stain easily. __eou__ Super easily.

I'm going back to college which is really bittersweet. __eou__ 5 __eou__ I'm sorry?  __eou__ I think that was a typo.  What did you study in college? __eou__ Well when I started, I studied typing, but that was almost forty years ago! __eou__ I didn't know that typing was a college major. We finally got some cool weather here. I'm happy because winter is my favorite season. __eou__ Are you getting any snow soon where you are? __eou__ Nah. I live in the south. We rarely get snow. I'm glad though because we can't ski. I'm so afraid of heights. __eou__ I am sorry to hear that, I love snow. It's flat where I live, so no skiing here either. __eou__ What do you like to do in your spare time? Have you ever traveled to a National Park? __eou__ No, I always mean to. In my spare time, I like to travel, went to DC most recently for museums.  __eou__ I love the museum of National History. Did you see Dorothy's shoes? __eou__ I mostly wound up at the human exhibits through time, I did not get to see the shoes. A shame, I grew up in kansas. __eou__ Oh really. Are you a Les Miles fan?

I'm feeling a little down since my wife will be gone for the weekend. __eou__ That's unfortunate. What are you going to do to keep yourself busy all weekend? __eou__ I'm not sure maybe order some chinese food and find a good book. __eou__ You could learn to cook chinese food. New experiences are always good. __eou__ I could do that, and surprise her with my new skill when she comes home. __eou__ I'm sure she'll love it! What type of books are you into? __eou__ Mysteries mostly.  You? __eou__ I love mysteries, but lately I've been reading the Berenstain Bears books, at the insistence of my child! They're illustrated children's novels like those in the  __eou__ My children love those.  Such good lessons in each. __eou__ I agree, the mysteries are great! It's also nice how the author can either stick to facts or be highly speculative. Makes for some varied reading. __eou__ Very true, however I believe technology has ruined the modern mystery, __eou__ How do you think technology has ruined the modern mystery? __eou__ much less leg work and creative thinking.   __eou__ Good point. Do you do anything creative?
I hate the ocean. I am very scared. __eou__ That's..intriguing. Is there any particular reason why you're scared of the ocean? __eou__ i have had a traumatic experience where i fell off of a fishing boat once __eou__ That's so sad! I'm sorry it happened. What do you do for work? __eou__ Currently i'm a production floor factory worker __eou__ That's cool. I'm trying to open my own grocery store __eou__ That's very entrepreneurial of you. Where are you going to open it ?  __eou__ I hope by the end of the year __eou__ i'd like to venture into my own business one day __eou__ It's hard but rewarding. I have some challenges like being color blind
well , i know how to count the cards , and i'm a dealer on the blackjack table __eou__ cool ! i'm thinking about investing into a company __eou__ what company? __eou__ It is with the Disney Corporation. __eou__ that sounds like a wise investment __eou__ True, I'm not one to take many risks. __eou__ maybe i should invest too, it might help me get through casino manager school __eou__ That sounds interesting, how much longer do you have to go? __eou__ 6 more years to go __eou__ Oh wow, is it very hard? __eou__ not really, i count cards for four hours straight __eou__ Oh really, I bet you are great in math? __eou__ i like to think so __eou__ Well good luck to you and any investments you make! __eou__ thank you!...you as well..do you have any tips?
aw , thank you so much , you are really nice __eou__ thank you people tell me i'm great __eou__ Haha, I'm sure they do. So, what do you like to do for fun? __eou__ My number on passion is photography.  But, I try to just have a lot of fun regardless of what I do. __eou__ Thats awesome, and the best way to live life. I love playing tennis, but I'm not all that great at it, if I'm honest. __eou__ Tennis is a hard sport. There is so much running. __eou__ Surprisingly, yes. For such a little area, you sure do run a lot. __eou__ I try to run a 10K each year.  What is your favorite color? __eou__ I love the color blue. What's your favorite? __eou__ Really! That's my favorite as well. __eou__ Thats awesome! Do you own your own place, or do you rent? __eou__ We are working on paying off our mortgage. You? __eou__ Same, actually. Cheaper than renting an apartment, and I can sing as loud and obnoxiously as I want to. __eou__ What kind of music do you like?
I know right. Some people I guess. I have a couple dogs but they're at my parents place. __eou__ They are so loyal and playful and loveable, some of the best companions in the world. __eou__ Yeah. When I play fortnite when I come back from the elementary school, little Tux comes and sits on my lap, it's adorable! __eou__ Aww, how cute. I want to meet your little fluffers. I bet she is a great companion and is good at aiding you. __eou__ You can come over this weekend. I'm sure they'll love you! Do you have any pets? __eou__ I do, a cat! Over the last few decades in Japan, we've started to adopt pets as more than utilitarian and more into our family system. __eou__ Oh wow! What color is it? Also, what does utilitarian mean? __eou__ It's black. Utilitarian means being more useful than appearance.  __eou__ Oh ok! I'll try and include that one in my next short story for my teacher. It must be very pretty! Can you show me a picture later? __eou__ I would love to but we can't share images on here :( __eou__ Aww that's okay I understand :( Do you play any games? __eou__ Yes I do! I build all my computers and deck it out with the latest hardware to play minecraft __eou__ Really?! That is so cool! I wish my parents would let me have my own computer. They think it would a bad influence. __eou__ It can but it can also help you out on academics as well. It's like a double edged sword.
I just took the bar exam this week. __eou__ That is great how do you think you did? __eou__ I think I did really well, i knew all of the right stuff to pass. __eou__ that's great i'm glad to hear it __eou__ I do however think I eat to much meat. I should probably try to eat less meat since it is not great for the environment. __eou__ I have so many questions about thie segue, your bar exam certification got you thinking about yor meat consumption? __eou__ it made me think about a lot of environmental problems that are going on right now and meat consumption is a big one, at least on an individual level. __eou__ How did it do that? Was there an ethical question component or something?  __eou__ There is a part that looks at your character and it just got me thinking of a lot of different things about myself. __eou__ I think systemically we ought to be pushing to address more dire environmental impacts instead of compartmentalizing small dietary choices, hoping they have the scale necessary __eou__ Well with most of the current administration being climate deniers i do think anything is going to change very soon. __eou__ Well, hopefully with smart educated minds like yours entering the law profession we can change that - and soon. I'm excited about the impact of EVs! __eou__ Yeah I think a Tesla is my dream car at this point.  __eou__ More a corevette for me! I would give anything for an electric corvette - something like that would just make my life utterly complete. 
i could eat pasta everyday , and i love chicken too __eou__ cool ! what do you do for a living again ? __eou__ I am a professional poker player,  I like to read to my cats in my freetime  __eou__ I am not good at poker, but I do like to play for fun. __eou__ I like to use my poker winnings to buy tuna.  It's my favorite food. __eou__ That's interesting! I wish I could have tuna, but I'm allergic. What else do you buy? __eou__ I like to buy things for my cats,  other than that I just pay my bills and play more poker __eou__ You have some lucky kitties! Have cat food prices gone up? Dog food prices are ridiculous! __eou__ Yes my cat has to eat science diet food as well so it is especially expensive __eou__ That is an expensive food. I guess you win a lot of money playing poker? __eou__ I make a decent amount average is around 20-30 dollars an hour __eou__ I wish I could make that kind of money. That could get you a lot where I'm from. __eou__ Yes it is quite the fortunate position to be in. __eou__ Do you play poker online to make that money?
I am not a butcher by any stretch, so always cut.  What about you? __eou__ I usually buy them whole if I am having a big party, because it saves a lot of money, but I will eat them any way I can get them.  Do you have any other favorite cuts? __eou__ I prefer sirloin. What about yourself? I also am prone to demanding my meat rare. I want to hear it moo.  __eou__ I'm a prime rib kind of guy myself. I like my steak medium though. I had it rare once and it made me sick __eou__ Oh, sorry to hear that! It isn't for everyone, I guess. So what do you do for a living? Or are you in school? __eou__ Unfortunately I'm not working right now. But I plan on going back to school in the spring what about you? __eou__ Are you majoring in anything in particular? __eou__ I'm trying to get a cybersecurity certification actually.  I don't have the cash for a 4 year school but computers pay out big! __eou__ So I've heard. My boyfriend is into computers. I'm a little clueless myself. What is cybersecurity? __eou__ I guess the best way to put it is to say its like the protection of networks. Keep people out that need to be out __eou__ That sounds cool, actually. Have you ever been hacked? That is one experience I don't want to have again. __eou__ I was on facebook a few years back. Aside from that no. My parents have been hacked a few times though __eou__ Is that part of the reason why you're interested in cybersecurity? As long as I never get my identity stolen, I won't complain.  __eou__ Of course! people put so much information online and I want to help protect it
Chocolate makes people happy, don't you agree? __eou__ I think Chocolate is a key to happiness! It's so sweet, those roasted cacao seeds are a blessing for us. __eou__ We have a chocolate factory in the town where i leave. I think it feeds my love of chocolate. __eou__ Have you ever had the seeds from the cacao tree? Before they are processed they are pretty bitter and are fermented before being processed into chocolate. __eou__ No I have not. Where do you purchase them? __eou__ they came to argentina where i am from and i met them in a drugstore . __eou__ You met who in a drugstore? __eou__ Sorry, I got the cacao seeds there. __eou__ Ah I see. I've never seen them in a drug store around here. I will ask my twin sister though. She works at a drug store. __eou__ If you can't find them locally, you can always find them online. __eou__ That's a good idea. I do a lot of shopping on amazon. Have you started Christmas shopping yet? __eou__ No, but I need to get started.  Have you? __eou__ Yes, I have a few people done already. I still have a lot left though. __eou__ We still have plenty of time, but it goes by fast this time of year.
I saw an old photo of my mom this morning. It made me miss the old times __eou__ That's always fun to look at pictures. __eou__ I know! The memories can be really sweet! __eou__ Do you get to see your mom often? __eou__ Not often, she lives far away __eou__ sO SAD,  i DON'T KNOW WHAT i WOULD DO WITHOUT MY MOTHER HERE. __eou__ Really? You two are close? __eou__ We are very close __eou__ Has it always been like that for you two? __eou__ Yes, but even more so once I had kids of my own. __eou__ So she helps a lot? __eou__ Oh yes and my kids adore her. They call her fairy Grandmother __eou__ Thats so cute!!! How many kids do you have? __eou__ 2.  Do you hve any?
That's amazing! I don't think I have heard his music __eou__ His music most revolves around racial, social, and inner city issies. __eou__ What is your favorite song of his? __eou__ Oh, man, that's tough. I guess today my answer would be Dear Mama. __eou__ I'll have to look that one up. I like listening to new music, expanding my horizons. __eou__ We need more musicians like him - he was really about the music. There's way too much commercial garbage on the radio these days. __eou__ That's so true. Aside from Tupac, who is your favorite artist? __eou__ I've got pretty diverse taste. It's hard to pin down a favorite. Lately I've been listening to a lot of Johnny Cash, though. __eou__ He's such a classic. As I've gotten older, I appreciate his music even more. __eou__ Absolutely. His voice is legendary. __eou__ So distinctive. His version of "Hurt" always gives me goosebumps. __eou__ It's a great one. I like how he managed to stay relevant up until the day he died. His life story is inspiring, too. __eou__ Yes, it is. He seemed to be a good man - he knew he wasn't perfect, but he tried his best. __eou__ He did. I like stories like that - people who aren't perfect but do the best they can.
Really? What are the first and second? __eou__ It's only behind Water and Tea __eou__ What's your favorite kind of beer? __eou__ I like IPA, they are usually better in bottles though, __eou__ I agree. I prefer glass bottles over cans for any drink. __eou__ Same, but cans are useful at the beach or really any outdoor function that isn't in someone's backyard. __eou__ That's true. __eou__ I wouldn't mind being on a beach with a drink in hand. This colder weather is already bumming me out. __eou__ I usually don't mind the cold weather too much until it starts to snow. __eou__ I really only like the cold weather because of snow. __eou__ I don't mind the snow, I just don't like driving in it __eou__ The right tires makes all the difference.  __eou__ Also a vehicle with moderate ground clearance doesn't hurt either. __eou__ True and a capable driver. 
I do not like the taste, texture or thought of eating meat. __eou__ So it has nothing to do with whether or not eating meat is ethical? There is a lot of debate around the ethics of eating meat.  __eou__ Well, I stopped eating it at first because of the taste, but the ethics makes me even happier with my decision. __eou__ same __eou__ Have you ever read "Eating Animals"? It's a great book and had me thinking a lot. It's about the animal agriculture industry. __eou__ I actually have! I am a big advocate against animal cruelty. __eou__ Oh that's great! Me too. I want to get involved with local activism. __eou__ I agree. More people should get involved to make a change. __eou__ Yeah, I agree. I think most people care, but they just don't know how to help. __eou__ There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians __eou__ That's true. Anything helps. It's hard to change something that has been the same for so many years. __eou__ If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track. __eou__ I agree! I always like to share what I know with other people, but some people get upset when they hear about the cruelty behind meat. __eou__ its graphic but needs to be known
i've to travel to ritzy parts of town , where i work in a dental office . __eou__ really ? cool , i use to ki in college __eou__ what was that like? __eou__ It was very tiring at first but I got the hang of it and it's really relaxing. __eou__ good to hear, what do you do in it? __eou__ I meditate and try to get the life energy to flow within me. This eases me. __eou__ sounds pleasant. i wish i had the time to relax as such. __eou__ just being aware of the moment is a kind of meditation . helps calm the spirit . __eou__ thanks for the advice, i'll make good use of it in the future. what do you like to do in your free time? __eou__ I really like just being able to escape to a different world. __eou__ have you ever had any interesting experiences doing so? __eou__ Yea! This one time I traveled to Japan and had a shiba dog companion. __eou__ i love shibas! did anything happen during that Japan trip? __eou__ I explored the city of Tokyo and was in awe at how much tech was around me. Also the ramen was good.
That sounds amazing!!!! How do you make those? __eou__ There are many versions, but the traditional recipe has butter, brown and white sugar, chocolate chips and vanilla. Good stuff.  __eou__ It is making me want some just thinking about it! __eou__ You should - there are loads of recipes online and it tastes so much better than store bought __eou__ I want to make some too, I have heard adding a little shortening with the butter helps. __eou__ Butter? I need to try that, I'm just using cheese and chopped vegetables. __eou__ lol, in chocolate chip cookies, that would be different? __eou__ Gotta keep it interesting, y’know?  My secret patented recipe: (no) cauliflower and chedder cookies. Gave ‘em out at halloween. Kids hated them - what do they know? __eou__ Funny, I bet they were shocked!
Yes it has. I personally blame the fast food industry - tons of cheap food laden with fat and sugar! __eou__ yea and its a major health issue as it has resulted in diseases such as coronary heart diseas that leads to mortality __eou__ That's why I never eat fast food. A sandwich is easier to find and easier to know what is in it. __eou__ I feel the same, I have high standards for my food and what I pay for, but fast food is so convenient. __eou__ It is, but that isn't always a good thing. Being filled with preservatives makes it cheap and easy to get to. __eou__ ok no problem __eou__ I understand its not for everyone, I don't really judge for eating fast food, I just know its not for me. __eou__ I feel the same, I have high standards for my food and what I pay for, but convenience wins  __eou__ I usually make a giant salad that I can store for days, if you keep it mostly dry, makes it easier to choose. __eou__ I will have to start doing that, i need to take control of my appearence __eou__ As an athlete, that's one of the most important things, controlling appearance and doing whats good for my body. __eou__ Exactly, looks are not the only think that matter in this world. but id so like to feel prettier __eou__ I understand. It's hard to feel good about yourself already in this world. I am sure you are still beautiful! __eou__ thank you ! need to appreciate and never take life for granted. i'm going to start making salads __eou__ I am proud of you! __eou__ You too! Thanks! was nice having this
i hate vegetables ! i do like being healthy as i often visit various national park __eou__ they think i've issues when i do not and have a hard time telling them that __eou__ Really, is that so? Interesting. __eou__ "cooking healthy meals taking long time." __eou__ I agree, it can take a long time but it is worth the time for your health __eou__ "agreed." __eou__ I'm glad you think so. What do you like to cook? __eou__ I enjoy Grilled meat and vegies __eou__ Me too! My favorite is zucchini __eou__ I Love Grilled Chicken, Pineapple and Bell Pepper __eou__ I also like those - how do you spice them? __eou__ usally add salt , Red pepper and lemon juice __eou__ that sounds amazing __eou__ mm.... Do you know any other healthy recipe
I like fried chicken too! What do you like about it? __eou__ That'd because what makes it different from others other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. __eou__ I find that soaking it in buttermilk before breading and frying are best __eou__ That actually sounds really good. I like mine hot so I season it heavily with spices. I might try soaking it though __eou__ Cajun spices in the batter are excellent! __eou__ Absolutely. Can't have good chicken without it. Sometimes I use dijon if its all I have __eou__ i'll have to try that. __eou__ Go for it. I try to read up on more vegetarian recipes because my fiance is a vegetarian and its kind of hard __eou__ yikes.  i cannot imagine! __eou__ Well she's a solid cook so she'll still make chicken and sausage for me sometimes. Some of the fake meat is good too! __eou__ i have had fake hotdogs before, they were disgusting.  I couldn't get past the smell. __eou__ That's funny because I just had some last night and loved the smell lol Have you tried the impossible beef? __eou__ no, is it made of tofu? __eou__ Nope. It's plant based and it tastes just like ground beef 
Oh really I thought they were made of vinyl?? __eou__ Kind of, they started being made with polyvinyl chloride in the 1950's. __eou__ Interesting.. do you collect old records? __eou__ I haven't bought any myself but my dad has a ton of polyvinyl chloride phonograph records. __eou__ Wow, that's so cool! I love looking through old things, especially when they belonged to my parents. __eou__ Yep, most of them come from my grandfather's collection, so they're pretty old __eou__ Very neat. Maybe they will be passed down to you in the future. __eou__ I already have some of them, but I need to get a turntable to play them __eou__ Do you need a special type of turntable or can you use anything? __eou__ Any turntable, as long as it can play the old 78 RPM's lol :) __eou__ You seem to know a lot about it. I have a lot of old records, but they are very dirty and don't play well. Maybe they just need cleaned. __eou__ It's quite easy to clean them - you just need some cleaning fluid, a nice lint free cloth and some time :) __eou__ I should give that a try then! Thanks for the information. __eou__ You're welcome :) Hope you get some good listening out of your cleaning efforts :)
that is not good , i love the movie dirty harry __eou__ and i do not like being obligated to spend time with friends __eou__ I am a mortician so I don't have many friends. __eou__ Wow...how is the mortician life __eou__ Its lonely and a bit sad. I talk to dead people all day. They don't talk back. What do you do? __eou__ I work with abused children so lack of sleep makes me need coffee __eou__ sounds like we both work in depressing industries. I always need my morning cup of coffee. I once knocked over a cup on a dead body. __eou__ Tragic!!! Good thing they couldn't feel it...how did you react __eou__ Chortled to myself. Luckily the outfit the family had provided hadn't been put on yet. __eou__ That would have been all bad. Can you imagine explaining that to the grieving family? __eou__ I couldn't imagine. I probably would have just had the outfit dry cleaned fast! DO you have any hobbies? __eou__ My hobby is catching up on missed rest and tv shows __eou__ Let me guess, you like to watch The Office? __eou__ Not at all...more like impractical jokers
just fine , do you have any interests ? __eou__ i love to go camping in my camper with my pink car __eou__ i love camping! __eou__ It is so fun. I love being able to show my kids different parts of the country. __eou__ where have you gone so far? __eou__ We love the mountains before it gets cold. The bike trails in Colorado are awesome. __eou__ i love the cold! more styleish clothing options __eou__ We travel with our cat sometimes. She doesn't like the cold weather. Her name is Leela. __eou__ aww she sounds adorable __eou__ She really is. She's a ragdoll cat and has the cutest gray face. __eou__ all gray? __eou__ No she has a white body. You should look us up. She has her own youtube channel. __eou__ totally!...whats the link? __eou__ Just look up colorado kitty on youtube. You will find her.
Have you ever owned one? Is there any risks to owning one that you know of? __eou__ I've never owned one. There are a few risks, as some of them are not exactly "pet-friendly," since they have antipredator adaptations, things like venom, and reflex bleeding, along with other non-painful tactics like camouflage and being able to sacrifice their own tails and regrow them to escape! __eou__ That sounds cool! How long have you had a lizard? __eou__ No I have not owned one, I have several other pets to deal with. __eou__ What type of pets are they? __eou__ I have two small dogs and a cat that I love to bits! __eou__ I've always been a dog person but cats are also up there for me. __eou__ I know they are like my babies, I enjoy spoiling them on a daily basis! __eou__ Do you take them out to the park often? __eou__ I take them to the beach as we live close and they love to smell the salt air and play in the waves! __eou__ You should take me some time I would love to go to the beach. __eou__ lol, I know its so healthy, do you enjoy the water? __eou__ Yes but I cant swim __eou__ Awww, Its good just to sit in the ocean and feel the sun on your face!
Gosh it is already 11:30pm and my kids are still awake! __eou__ That's the worst!. Mine was up extra late tonight too. __eou__ How do you get yours worn down enough to finally fall asleep?! I'm starting to get used to sleeplessness. __eou__ Sometimes its just a battle of the wills.  I've gotten to the point where sometimes she just has to cry until she falls asleep. __eou__ I think my will power is the problem. I'm so undisciplined these days. I haven't even made it to the gym I just joined. __eou__ I know; having kids is sometimes so tiring it's hard to stay disciplined.  I work out at home now using youtube. __eou__ I guess as parents we do most everything at home. Work out at home. Shop from home. Eat at home. __eou__ I agree!  I'm thankful to be able to stay home with them though, and not have to put them in daycare. __eou__ As challenging as it can be sometimes, I am grateful too. My husband and I have always agreed that we don't want our kids in daycare. __eou__ Yeah, they won't stay little for very long.  Though I do miss going out with our friends and having some adult time.  Haha! __eou__ Ahh...being young and wild. Going out dancing! And eating good food without someone in your lap. Haha! __eou__ Even if we got a babysitter that I trust, I don't think I'd have the energy to go dancing. I'm doing well to make some popcorn and watch a movie. __eou__ I doubt I'd be familiar with any of the latest hits. I'm stuck in the 80's even though I was born toward the end of them. __eou__ Someday we will be out in the real world again.  For now, I'm happy to snuggle my sweet baby and sing her to sleep.
I'm jealous of my friend's new house. For his age, it's really nice! __eou__ how old is he or she? __eou__ 28 __eou__ You should be very happy for him! That's great. Do you have a house? __eou__ I unfortunately do not, it is such a financial commitment and my income is lacking. __eou__ I'm right there with you. I am a teacher, so my pay isn't enough to put in to the house that I want.  __eou__ In my current position in just seems like a dream to one day own a house. __eou__ Hopefully you will be able to save and find something great one day. I have been saving, and I hope to buy one in the next five years. __eou__ That is a realistic goal and sounds very achievable. Good luck! __eou__ Thank you! Good luck to you as well. What do you do for work? __eou__ Currently working in a smoothie shop to pay the bills. __eou__ That sounds fun! I recently started working at a school teaching 26 students. __eou__ Teaching is so vital to our society. __eou__ Absolutely! Especially with early learning in children. It is very rewarding.
Today has been uneventful but, I got a lot of errands done. __eou__ That is always good! Errands can be a pain! __eou__ Hey, nice to meet you, where are you from? __eou__ I'm from Florida. How about you, where are you from? __eou__ I am living in London and just eating some fruits after those errands  __eou__ I would love to visit London! This summer I vacationed in Italy. It was beautiful! __eou__ You really should, there is a lot to see here! Amazing im sure it was relaxing. In which city have you been?  __eou__ I only had enough time to go to Rome and Naples. All that history in Rome - I could spend a year there and still want more!
i agree . i definitely feel better about myself since i met my husband . __eou__ i love spending time with my friends and family as well . __eou__ Yes, me too, I love playing with my kids __eou__ It's almost as therapeutic as doing art to me. __eou__ I m very much interested in sewing __eou__ I have never done that personally before I am more of a graphic design person __eou__ ohh ok, I learned through you tube video __eou__ Youtube is a great place to find art tutorials.  I have learned many things myself from youtube. __eou__ yep, agree, Need to watch limited video, otherwise we will get confused __eou__ Yeah it's important to slow down if you aren't getting a good grasp on what they are trying to teach. __eou__ what are all your other hobbies ? __eou__ I really just spend the rest of my free time with those that are close to me. __eou__ good, I m very much interested in playing table tennis __eou__ I haven't played it myself in a very long time, but I did when I was younger.
I dropped my son off at daycare for the first time this week. __eou__ Nice. What was his first day? __eou__ It was on Monday. He seemed scared, so I felt a little bit guilty. __eou__ Oh no! I'm sure it was just due to meeting new people. What is your favorite activity to do with him? __eou__ He loves to be read to. I think he's going to be a really smart kid, just like his dad. :) __eou__ Aww that's so sweet. Yea, he'll be very happy. What books do you read to him? __eou__ He likes the Frog & Toad series! Did you read those when you were a kid? They're very funny. __eou__ I did, and brought a copy to read to my son too, they're enjoyable! Do you have any other recommendations? __eou__ We like the classics. Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, etc.. What about you? What do you usually read? __eou__ I enjoy reading Dr. Seuss books to my son, such good material. __eou__ Oh, I didn't even think of those. Yes, those are definitely great. Dr. Seuss was in a class of his own. __eou__ Yeah, thanks for the recommendations! Do you plan to take your kid back to daycare anytime soon? __eou__ Oh yes! He might not like it, but it's good for him to socialize. I think he will grow to love it. __eou__ I'm sure he will, maybe he can share some of your favourite books with the rest of the class.
I like tennis too. What exactly is a grand slam in tennis though? __eou__ They are the major tennis game with the highest reward but highly competitive. Australian Open in mid January, the French Open in May and June  __eou__ Oh right, I see ... I love tennis but I could never seem to find the time to play __eou__ The matches are very long. But, you can still practice with friends and get the same feeling. __eou__ Maybe I need to learn to get my motivation levels up ... Or I could ask my friend to encourage me :)  __eou__ Practice can always help. You could find a pro that you like as well. __eou__ Ah, the pros I like are getting older now, like me :) I loved Agassi, but I like watching Nadal now too. He's so entertaining __eou__ Nadal is one of my favorites. Did you watch him in the US open this year? __eou__ Oh yes I did :) He never fails to draw me into a match __eou__ I wish I could find someone like him to date. I'm still single. __eou__ Yep, the single life gets a little much sometimes ...  __eou__ I go on on dates regularly. Its exhausting. __eou__ Exactly ... Sometimes it feels like more trouble than it's worth. It's better staying home, having a bath and read a book :) __eou__ That sounds like my kind of night! __eou__ Yep, with a little chocolate and wine added, excellent night :)
Is a vegan diet more healthy than a diet that consists of animal byproducts? __eou__ Sometimes... It depends how careful the person is balancing their diet. A well planned vegan diet reduces the risk of some chronic diseases, like heart disease.  __eou__ are you a vegan? __eou__ I am not, but I've heard well-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, like heart disease. __eou__ thats good to hear. I just decided to become vegan and am trying to adjust.  __eou__ It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian? __eou__ maybe I'll try it as a bit of a stepping stone. Usually I like to just jump in to things head first.
do you watch sports ? i love watching hockey __eou__ i watch ultimate disc league , soccer , hockey and golf with my son . __eou__ Yes, I do love sports its a good way to get exercise! __eou__ good way to keep warm in Michigan, too. Ultimate Disc League is our favorite. __eou__ I bet it can get very cold , I love hockey it is so exciting! __eou__ It gets freezing! Especially if you live by the Ohio River. __eou__ I was born in New York so I know how cold it can get! __eou__ on yes, New York i'm sure gets plenty of cold weather, do you have any kids? I bet they love playing in the snow. __eou__ Yes, I have children but we have moved to Florida and enjoy the ocean now! __eou__ Lucky! I would like to take the kids during the winter months for some fun in the sun! __eou__ You should we do a lot of water sports now and its so enjoyable! __eou__ What sort of water sports do you like to do that is family oriented? __eou__ We do a lot of boating, fishing, skiing with ocean fun! __eou__ awesome! i visit lake michigan every summer! we do the same things but i bet it is so much more fun in the ocean!!
do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ no . i just clean my house all day . you ? __eou__ I love playing video games and eating pizza. __eou__ video games range from computers to small hand held devices. which do you prefer? __eou__ Generally computers. How about you? __eou__ I own a ps4 and gaming PC but almost never touch the ps4. Been playing a ton of Modern warfare on pc though. __eou__ It that game any good? My brother and I have been debating on getting that or not. __eou__ The campaign is the best campaign in call of duty history. The multiplayer does have some issues that need to be worked out though. __eou__ Have you tried the survival mode? Im not into pvp as much since I'm horrible at shooters. __eou__ Yeah there is 5 coop missions that are pretty fun and very very challenging and horde is pretty fun but also pretty hard.  __eou__ The last modern warfare game I touched was MW3, how much better is the new one. __eou__ Story wise its better in every way. The coop missions however are not as good in my opinion as MW3. __eou__ Does MW large scale compare to Battlefield? I love the open map warfare of Battlefield. __eou__ Yeah, modern warfare has a new mode called ground war that takes place on huge maps with tanks and jets.
i really enjoy fall though . makes me feel deep . __eou__ i need to go soon . my car is in the shop , should have never bought a passa . __eou__ Do you want another cup of tea before you go? __eou__ I can't say no to hot tea. I might grab some cake too before I head out. __eou__ I love our visits.  Have you ever thought about belonging to a bookclub? __eou__ I have, actually. But I don't know any to join. Are you a part of one? __eou__ No, but we could start our own!  There's so many good books I want to read. __eou__ I wish I had more time to read, honestly. But maybe a book club is just what I need to get motivated. __eou__ Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction? Adventure or romance?   __eou__ I cannot stand romance novels. Too cheesy. Non-fiction, on the other hand, is my favorite! What about you? __eou__ I like both, but I especially like nonfiction books about travel - I'd love to travel, but for now I just read about it! __eou__ If you want to see the world, you should come with me! I mostly travel on business, but it would be nice to have a companion. __eou__ What's your next destination?  How long do you usually stay? __eou__ I'm meeting with members of our partner company in Ontario next week. My trips usually last about a week.
you mean like magic tricks ? __eou__ yes . you should watch penn and teller __eou__ I love Penn and Teller. I love decorating cakes too. __eou__ That's awesome! You can watch them while you make some cakes, lol. How long have you been decorating cakes? __eou__ Ever since I realized I was a lesbian. So, around 12. What do you like to do? __eou__ I like to research about science and space. I want to be an astronaut one day. That's my dream! __eou__ That's a wonderful aspiration! Are you in college? __eou__ I am still in high school, so I am still figuring out where I should go. Hopefully I get some scholarships too. __eou__ High school is the perfect time to look into / apply for scholarships. However, playing a sport would probably help more to pay for college. __eou__ That's great advice. Do you play any sports? __eou__ No, I don't. Unless you consider hiking a sport.  __eou__ Haha, well that's more exercise than I ever get. I am not very athletic. __eou__ Exercise is good for you! Try going for a small walk. What is your favorite food? Mine is cake obviously. __eou__ I love cake too! Anything sweet. That's probably even more reason to start walking, lol. __eou__ Definitely! Try it. You'll feel great after a good walk.
i do not know what that's . __eou__ i love spongebob because i'm a huge fan __eou__ I love Mr. Bean,  Whenever I m watching his shows , I coulnt control laughing __eou__ I love Mr. Bean as well. I watched his shows when I was younger. __eou__ now a days I like to watch stand up comedy show __eou__ I like to watch comedy shows on my television. __eou__ what is your other hobbies? __eou__ I play video games. __eou__ I have interested in art.  so i watch you tube video and learning to do __eou__ I watch spongebob on youtube. __eou__ ok, what is your favorite restaurant? __eou__ My favorite restaurant is Mcdonalds. __eou__ mine is Olive garden. __eou__ Olive garden is good. I go there sometimes.
I was watching a friend of my show of his juggling skills recently. I got to say, I was quite dazzled by his skills! __eou__ Wow, how long has he been juggling for? __eou__ He has been doing it for years.  I am failing my classes because I spend all my time watching him. __eou__ Yeah, that seems like a skill that must practiced a lot. __eou__ I don't know how he does it.  We like to spend time in nature while I just watch him juggle. __eou__ That sounds relaxing. __eou__ Yes it's great.  We are going on a camping trip in the mountains next week. __eou__ That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains? __eou__ The Appalachian mountains __eou__ Yeah I heard that is beautiful country out there. __eou__ If you have never been yourself I highly recommend it.  I used to go every year as a child. __eou__ I would live to go one day, I should plan it. __eou__ The weather is beautiful as well.
what do you make there ? cars , boats , planes or goods and sprockets ? __eou__ i build commercial planes i work the night shift . do you have any kids __eou__ I have two daughters. Do you have any children? __eou__ Yes I have a son and just recently i became a grandpa __eou__ Congratulations! That's great. Do you have any hobbies? __eou__ Thank you! I try to not feel old haha. Yes I love playing soccers with my friends quite often.  __eou__ Keeping active will make you feel younger and healthy too. Will you teach your grandchild soccer? __eou__ That is so right. It feels so much better than just becoming passive when getting older. Of course I will, keeping the heritage :) __eou__ Wonderful. I am sure they will appreciate that! I like to photograph nature in my free time. __eou__ Sorry I talked so much about myself! Thats amazing, nature is so calming. Do you just photograph nature? __eou__ That's okay! Yes, I mostly photograph nature, but I like to photograph other things as well, like people and landmarks. __eou__ Do you do it professionally or is it just a hobby? I just take pictures occasionally with my wife. __eou__ People have paid me to photograph them before, but it is mostly a hobby. I work as a lawyer. __eou__ Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes
i do some graphic design for a few places __eou__ oh are you any good at it ? __eou__ If I do say so myself. What do you do __eou__ I'm a graphic designer! I design company logos __eou__ That's interesting. How long have you been doing that? __eou__ fir several years, i really love the work
Can you tell me who the main actors are in it? __eou__ Certainly! The main actors were Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard and Olivia Havilland. They did such a great job. __eou__ Yeah, it's such an amazing movie, always makes me tear up. __eou__ I wonder if any of them enjoyed mystery flavour cake lol :) __eou__ I'm sure they would have. What type of movies make you emotional? __eou__ Outdoor movies, where I can take my collection of toys wearing their rain coats in case of bad weather :) __eou__ Nice, I'm more of a fan of Mystery Thriller movies myself, though I don't have any toys to bring with me sadly. __eou__ Toys add to the mystery and I can hug them if it gets too scary - you should try :) __eou__ I'll give it a shot. What toys do you recommend getting? __eou__ You can never go wrong with a teddy bear, the fluffier the better. That's why they need their rain coats :) __eou__ Thanks for the advice! How many toys do you have yourself? __eou__ I have way too many that have ended up in the attic - I don't like them being in the dark, so I visit them. __eou__ That's cute, I'll make sure to take care of my teddy when I get them then, just for you! __eou__ It's always a good idea to take care of your teddy bears, sometimes they're better listeners than people :)
I agree! I love to spend an afternoon with a novel and a cup of tea. What else do you know about reading? __eou__ Yes! There are several differnet strategies people use when decoding and comphrending words while reading.  __eou__ Ooo, exciting. Tell me more __eou__ I could make some coffee and you could inform me of the stories. __eou__ That sounds like an excellent plan. __eou__ So I am ready whenever you are __eou__ Sounds good. Maybe we can meet up later. __eou__ Sounds like a plan, just call me.  __eou__ Will do! What else are you up to today? __eou__ Just going to work for a few hours. __eou__ Where do you work? __eou__ I work in an office in Atlanta. __eou__ Very cool! Is it nice there? __eou__ Absolutely, I love it. 
milk makes strong bones though , how do you supplement your diet ? __eou__ i'm vegetarian . you can get all your nutrition from plants , you know ? __eou__ Is it possible to be buff being a vegetarian? __eou__ I wouldn't know, I'm hardly "buff" but feel healthy! __eou__ I run and swim alot so I was just wondering if just eating plants alone will help me. __eou__ Well, you still need protein for sure but you can get that through beans, tofu, etc.   __eou__ Wow I honestly did not know tofu had any protein. What's your favorite dish? __eou__ I love all veggies so I often do a stir fry and spice it up with some chiles.   __eou__ That sounds very good! I need to try that out one day. How can I make it? __eou__ I don't use a recipe; just heat some OVO and quickly cook the veggies.  I like them still crunchy.  Add spices as desired. __eou__ What is OVO? __eou__ Olive oil.  If you like nuts, they are a good source of protein too.  Just add some cashews or walnuts! __eou__ I sound so dumb now. Do you recommend any veggies I should get? __eou__ Oh, never say dumb!  You're learning!  I like cabbage, zucchini, onions, celery, carrots, and red or green peppers.   __eou__ Thank you so much for everything! I'll keep this in mind the next time I cook.
I didn't realize it was that large. Have you seen The Wolf of Wallstreet? __eou__ Yeah I have, it was really good. It was set near Broadway and the South Street. __eou__ I agree, it's a great movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and handsome too, lol. __eou__ He is a very great actor. I also like him in Gangs of New York. __eou__ Oh, I've never seen that, but I have heard of it! I'll have to watch it. I don't watch a lot of movies, but I want to watch more. __eou__ You should watch it. It's a great movie. What do you like to do? __eou__ Well, I work a lot, but when I get home I like to spend time with my dog and take walks. __eou__ That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! I also have two dogs. What kind of dog do you have? __eou__ She's a poodle! They're a very smart breed. What about you? __eou__ I love poodles! My aunt has two. I also like bigger dogs, just do not have room. I have a beagle. __eou__ Awwwe, how cute. Yeah, I always wanted a big dog too, but I don't want to coop them up in a small apartment. __eou__ I am in the same situation. But my beagle loves to go on runs and go to the dog park. __eou__ Have you ever had any problems at the dog park, like a fight with another dog? __eou__ Fortunately I have not. My dog is very friendly with people and other dogs. Most of the other dogs there are very friendly too.
In the past year, I was caught cheating on my wife. __eou__ That's awful. Did you have to cheat? __eou__ No, I didn't and I realize it was wrong. __eou__ People make mistakes. Have you made up with her? __eou__ I am currently in the process of trying to work things out. __eou__ I wish you the best of luck, and hope you learned from it. Do you all have kids together? __eou__ I do realize it was a huge mistake.  We don't have any kids. __eou__ Do you want any in the future? __eou__ We're unsure at the moment. I think that maybe one day we might. __eou__ It can be a huge decision. Kids are very expensive. Did you grow up with any siblings? __eou__ I had a brother, but he passes away in a car accident several years ago. __eou__ That's horrible. I am sorry for your loss. I can't imagine going through something like that. __eou__ Thank you. I appreciate that.  It has been a struggle to move forward. __eou__ I can only imagine. I'm forunate i've never had to experience that.
I got a new job. There's so much debt I want to clear off __eou__ Is it a well paying one? __eou__ Not as good as my boyfriend's gig, but it should do the trick! I'm hoping I won't have to get a second one.  __eou__ I have four kids and I always tell them to be careful with debt. It can help you if used wisely; it can also be a pain! __eou__ I wish my parents had been smart enough with money to give me that kind of advice. They spend more time arguing than helping me out. __eou__ That's truly a shame. My husband and I just split up, but I always made sure we didn't argue in front of the kids. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes I wish my moms would split. But I think my younger brother would take it pretty hard. __eou__ Yeah, it's hard on the young ones. Mine are all old enough to understand. You said "moms" - do you have 2 moms? __eou__ Yep, I got two. My brother is pretty much outnumbered. Our two dogs are even females.  __eou__ That's pretty neat to have 2 moms. Except your brother being outnumbered by estrogen, ha ha. __eou__ It definitely has its perks. So what is it like after divorce? Any better than an unhappy marriage? __eou__ Yes, better to be alone than having to fight with someone all the time. __eou__ I hope I didn't overstep by asking that question. I'm just curious. If my parents keep it up, I'm afraid that might be our future. __eou__ It's always hard when families break up. However, if everybody tries to respect the others, it can end up being even better for all.
i won 2nd place in a spelling bee when i was 11 __eou__ what word did you get wrong ? __eou__ alcohol is the word I misspelled   __eou__ That's a shame, but 2nd place is nothing to be ashamed of either way. You should be proud! __eou__ Yes I won the entire contest the year prior so it is ok. __eou__ Did any prizes come with the victory? Gift cards and the such? __eou__ I was given an article in the new yorker magazine as well as savings bonds. __eou__ That's quite impressive! I'll take it that it was a national competition and not a local one? __eou__ Yes it was the national spelling bee. __eou__ That's nice. I was never too good at spelling __eou__ It's just a matter of practicing  __eou__ Ha, it must be true if the champion says so ;) Do you still participate in these events? Even if only as a host __eou__ I will be too old to enter the event next year.  I do not plan to attend __eou__ Aw, that's a shame. You should tell me more about that this weekend. Are you free sunday
nope not at all . just a small city . live a simple life . __eou__ i think you are downplaying it a lot __eou__ Well not much has happened to me in the past year. __eou__ Have you made the effort to travel at all?  You know, get out and see something new? __eou__ I would but my landlord increased the rent so I don't have any money to save up. __eou__ That's too bad!  But it doesn't have to cost alot.  I love just to drive old country roads and tent camp. __eou__ You're right. I'll try to find someone to help me with transportation costs on road trips. __eou__ That's excellent thinking!  There's nothing like hiking to clear your head and feel freedom. __eou__ Have you been on any road trips or hiking ? __eou__ Oh yes, I take road trips often.  If it's bad weather, I sleep in the back of my car but I prefer to pitch a tent. __eou__ Do you travel with anyone else? __eou__ Once in while with my spouse, but mostly by myself.  I like to hike in the wilderness and enjoy God's great creation. __eou__ That sounds so calming and relaxing. Do you have any recommendations?? __eou__ National parks are great, but just get out on the back roads.  Find a quiet place to make camp and explore!
Ive been wanting to start reading some true crime books myself but never seem to have the time, Any good crime books that you would recommend?  __eou__ Stephen Richards writes pretty good books, he is a great author __eou__ I heard about him. Is there a book you can recommend by him, something that catches me from the start? __eou__ Yes, check out "Psycho Steve". __eou__ Thank you mate! So, do you have any others interests beside reading? __eou__ I like to drink cappuccinos at Starbucks. __eou__ you seem like you enjoy time by yourself. I actually made my only hobby to my profession, I play for the baltimore orioles __eou__ Baltimore Orioles is my favorite team in the mlb. __eou__ You are da man! We had such a good season this year
i love calisthenics , recently i moved up my push ups to a total of 1000 and astonished at what the body is capable   __eou__ Wow, that is awesome! How long does that take? __eou__ it feels like it takes forever, lol. But it really helps me to stay flexible :) __eou__ I can only imagine, It takes a lot of determination.  __eou__ A lot of determination and plenty of bottles of water :) Always makes me thirsty.  __eou__ Water is great for the soul. __eou__ Yep, as we're mostly made up of water, it seems to make sense to stay hydrated. And it reminds me to water my horses. __eou__ Wow, I did not know you have horses. Are they fun? __eou__ Great fun! And another brilliant form of exercise that doesn't really feel like exercise if you know what I mean? __eou__ Of course, I can only imagine. Sounds like pure fun. __eou__ Yep, and then after that I have a yoga session to wind down. __eou__ I've heard yoga is super relaxing.  __eou__ Yep, I'm an instructor, but it never feels like work. It's super addictive :) __eou__ I think I'm going to give it a try.  __eou__ Yep, I would highly recommend it :)
WHo directed game of thrones.  __eou__ The Directors change.  But it was created by David Benioff and DB Weiss. __eou__ oh really? i wonder why the directors changed so much... __eou__ Its quite common for TV shows to have different directors for each episode. __eou__ so its not because their performance was poor? __eou__ No its usually because of scheduling. __eou__ I am a mechanic. What do you do? __eou__ an actor. mostly in theatre. what type of mechanic work do you do? __eou__ on classic cars! __eou__ cool, do you own any old cars your self?  __eou__ yes i have a 1964 mustang __eou__ Nice. what color is it?  __eou__ its red! with white striping
I do not. My cousin does though. Do your stamina issues interfere with daily life? __eou__ It was apparently developed post-natal, so after birth, an it has become progresively worse, so it is getting there __eou__ How do you feel about it? __eou__ It has gotten better with some therapy. At times I am still a little down. __eou__ Do you do anything to help with that? __eou__ I've tried some natural remedies, and I have a very large cd collection that I listen to, to try to take my mind off things. __eou__ I like music also. Who do you listen to when you are depressed? __eou__ I like to listen to something with an upbeat message to it. I tend to listen to classic rock. What kind of music do you like? __eou__ The same. Pink Floyd. Led Zeppelin. Like that. __eou__ I'm a huge fan of Led Zeppelin myself. Do you have any favorite songs? __eou__ The Song Remains the Same and No Quarter off their live New York show. __eou__ Fantastic choices. No Quarter is one of my favorite. I may have to go with Kashmir as being my absolute favorite though. Wish I could have seen them live. __eou__ Me Too. I just missed Page and Plant once. really bummed me out. __eou__ It would bum me out too. Plant has some of the best vocals ever, and Jimmy was quite the wizard on guitar.
What is the no kill shelter? __eou__ The policy of a no kill shelter is to keep as many animals alive as possible, so they treat and rehab unhealthy animals where possible. __eou__ That seems like a noble cause. __eou__ For sure! I used to work for one, so I'm a little passionate about it. __eou__ I imagine that can be a very rewarding job.  I love animals. __eou__ Do you have any furry friends? I've got a husky mix named Cherry.  __eou__ Awesome.  I have a basset hound named Banjo. __eou__ That's the most adorable name ever. I love when people choose unique dog names. Too many Daisy's and Cooper's. __eou__ Thank you. I agree.  I always try to come up with something different. __eou__ I just ran into this girl I knew back in high school. She named her dog Peeve. You can imagine why... __eou__ That is hilarious!  Very creative! __eou__ Creative, yes. But poor doggie. :) __eou__ LOL.  I am sure she loves him very much. ;) __eou__ Yeah, you could tell she loved him to death. Are you a cat person? __eou__ I think cats are alright, but I am more of a dog person.
My birthday is tomorrow __eou__ How old will you be? __eou__ I will be 32. __eou__ Happy early birthday.  Will you be celebrating? __eou__ Thank you! I will be having dinner with my husband, but I mostly want to relax and take the day off work. __eou__ That sounds like a great time.  I used to not be able to do much for my birthdays because I was a truck driver. __eou__ That's unfortunate. My dad used to be a truck driver and would often work holidays.

I quit after I got married.  __eou__ Do you have children? __eou__ No I don't my husband and I is pretty enough for us. __eou__ I am in the same boat.

I enjoy spending time with my husband. __eou__ That's great you are able to do that.  I also love my husband.
I've never had Italian food! What's a common dish? __eou__ Pizza is the best of the best when it comes to classic italian cuisine __eou__ Oh, I guess I think of pizza as being  __eou__ Yea its great when topped with meat and vegetables,  you should try it __eou__ I have - I think of Pizza as American!  Haha!  I don't get out too much but pizza is easy to have delivered. __eou__ Yea especially since pizza delivery is so convenient and available in some parts of the world like the US. but Italian style pizza is unique __eou__ What makes it unique?  I just never go to fancy restaurants. __eou__ The way they bake it is not like the commercial style in the U.S. its less oily __eou__ What are your favorite toppings?  Is it thick or thin crust? __eou__ thin crust , my favorite toppings is always meat. what are your preferences ? __eou__ I like all veggies especially green or greek olives, and feta cheese. __eou__ that's nice , i tend to like the big individual slices with sausage and mushrooms . Have you had any of lately ? __eou__ No, I tend to stay home and eat very simply - lots of salads or fresh fruit and cheese.  Do you live in a big city? __eou__ I do not, but I live right outside of it, so I get the culture. so you are a health conscious person ?
So my kid loves to play with stupid model cars and stupid tiny legos. Well he didn't clean them up and this morning I rolled out of bed tired and walked to the kitchen and stepped on a stupid lego! __eou__ Oh NO...That should be reserved for the worst prisoners. That hurts! __eou__ I guess I can't complain too much. I knew it was part of the job description.  __eou__ I guess that does go with the territory.
"Last winter a big snow storm was approaching. I had to rush around to get the final stuff and the snow had already started. __eou__ Were you able to get all the things you needed in time __eou__ Unfortunately I was unable to get everything that I needed.  __eou__ I m very unfamiliar with snow storms because i Live in California, I would guess it is much like preparing for wildfire __eou__ I'm in the Midwest. Weather here is so unpredictable. A lot of times the news will call for snow or ice and we don't get any, or vice versa.  __eou__ do you live in midwest, Not much dynamic in weather here __eou__ Yes I live in Missouri. You can experience all four seasons in one day. California weather seems so much nicer, but without the wildfires.  __eou__ we are very much bothering about traffic, taking too much time to travel one place to another place __eou__ There's a lot of traffic here too depending on if you're in a big city or not.  __eou__ mmm,   Planning to move Florida or North Carolina __eou__ That sounds nice. I love the beach.  __eou__ ya, Me too.  How about texas weather? do you know anything about it? __eou__ I know that it's hot and they get a lot of tornadoes. We get them in Missouri too. Have you ever been in a tornado? __eou__ Personally have not, But I heard about that
Time is moving so fast! I remember when they didn't exist at all __eou__ Yeah and I remember when cell phones were the size of a brick, lol. iPhones run Apple's iOS mobile operating system. __eou__ OMG yes, those brick phones are so funny. My grandma still uses a flip phone.. they're still out there. __eou__ My grandma uses one, too! I have to explain to my parents how to perform tasks on their smartphones all the time __eou__ Yeah, I know.. I think it's easier for them to use Apple products. They are simpler to figure out and less prone to error. __eou__ I have always had Android phones and have never had an issue with the OS. The iOS seems more confusing to me, really. __eou__ Really? I guess it depends on the person then. Maybe in the future phones will just read our minds and do what we need, lol. __eou__ That would be fantastic lol. It really does seem like technology is moving quickly enough that it could be a possibility in the future. __eou__ Yeah! I can't wait to be able to use a self-driving car. It's a little scary, but they say it's safer than a human driver. __eou__ I think it would help eliminate road rage at the very least. Also, you could play on the phone while "driving" and not have to really worry about it! __eou__ That's true, robots don't feel rag. Or at least not yet... Haha.  __eou__ Yep, another example of technology moving super-rapidly. AI could develop road rage over time and kill us all lol __eou__ That's a hilarious thought. I'm sure someone will make a movie about it eventually. __eou__ "Planet of the Cars" sounds plausible, like an awful B-Rated movie. :P
Last vacation I collected rocks to take home and remember the trip by __eou__ I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything __eou__  Oh, I love to collect rocks and sea-glass. I have a rock tumbler my kids got me as a present __eou__ I always wanted to get a rock tumbler. Sadly I never think to get one __eou__ I never got around to it, and then my kids surprised me :) The pebbles inspire me to write poetry too. __eou__ I like poetry. Have you had anything published? __eou__ A couple of small collections :) I started as a proofreader for greetings cards believe it or not :) __eou__ Everyone has to start somewhere __eou__ Yep, and as I love reading and words in general, it seemed like a good opportunity for my first steps. __eou__ When oppotunity knocks you have to answer __eou__ Definitely, otherwise you never find out what's on the other side of that door :) __eou__ The only way to succeed is to try __eou__ Yep, and then try and try again if you don't get there the first time :) __eou__ that is so true __eou__ You just have to try and have faith in yourself, even when it's hard to do :)
my eyes are brown . do you have any tattoos ? __eou__ i don't but would like some . you ? __eou__ yea, i just recently got my third tattoo, and probably more in the future.  __eou__ I want some soon. __eou__ Nice, do you already have a motive in mind?  __eou__ Yes, I want to get Barack Obama's face on my arm.  __eou__ Haha never thought of getting a face as a tattoo, do you admire him?  __eou__ Absolutely, I love him. __eou__ Same here, and then came Trump. Obama had some house parties with my favorite musicians, he sure has taste __eou__ Yeah, I could never agree with Trump. He's a tool. __eou__ So true.. I actually work as a guard in the white house, so keep it for youself. They don't want us to have any opinions or leak information __eou__ Oh wow, I will pray for you.  __eou__ I Appreciate it haha  __eou__ No problem whatsoever.  __eou__ Alright see you around 
You should. Pregnancy is a big thing in one's life.  Always use a condom they say. __eou__ Yup, condoms are a huge deal. Properly used condoms in every act of intimacy lowers pregnancy change per year to 2%. __eou__ We actually planned for this child, and i'm very excited. Did you plan on having multiple kids, or none at all? __eou__ I want kids. Just not yet. __eou__ It's very expensive trying to raise a kid. Do you have any hobbies? __eou__ I like the outdoors. Backpacking is a big deal to me. __eou__ I love the outdoors as well. Have you had the chance to go backpacking anywhere you really wanted to? __eou__ I've been to Colorado many times. The Uncompaghre area is really nice. __eou__ I've always wanted to go to Colorado, i haven't had the chance yet unforunately. Where is your dream destination? __eou__ I would love to go to Tibet, but I would be hard pressed to trust China. Maybe Nepal. __eou__ Yeah things are looking pretty rough over there as of late. Tibet would be beautiful though, so would Nepal. I would love the chance to go to Switzerland. __eou__ Yes the Alps would be great. I've been to France but not the mountains there. __eou__ I've never been, but would love to visit there as well. I have been to Italy though, and that was amazing. __eou__ I had a friend in High School with relatives in the Dolomites and he took me with him once.
The other day I saw a man take a dog from the street, I've been seeing that dog for a while and in a couple of days I see this dog on the streets again, poor little thing. I thought it'd have a better life. __eou__ That's sad, I wonder why the dog can't find a home! __eou__ I hope that nothing is wrong with it.  Hopefully somone will take him in. __eou__ I sure hope so. I'd take him in myself but I can't have dogs in my apartment __eou__ That is unfortunate I'm going on a cruise next month and need to find someone to watch my dog. __eou__ My parents used to just board there dog when they went on vaca it was expensive though. What kind of dog is it? __eou__ My dog would have a heart attack if I did that.  It is an english bulldog. __eou__ I've always wanted an English bulldog. They are absolutely adorable __eou__ Yes my parents have one also, they just moved to florida __eou__ Oh yeah? I hope they have fun. My stepdad was on duty down there for a while had a blast __eou__ Yeah it's pretty nice, but a little too hot for me. __eou__ I feel that. The summers there must be brutal __eou__ Yeah I don't think I could handle that kind of weather. __eou__ Facts. I gotta admit its better than snow in the middle of February lol
a nissan z she's second love of my life outside my dog lucky __eou__ that's great . i am glad for you . __eou__ I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm bragging, it's just that I've been given a second chance at life and really want to enjoy it! __eou__ ok, how so ? __eou__ I'm in remission from cancer; I don't make a ton of money but if there's something I want to enjoy I go for it! __eou__ Im sorry to hear that. I heard there is 100 different types of cancer. its good to know that your a survivour  __eou__ It's something you learn to live with, the possibility of it returning.  But it's made me more thankful and appreciative of all I've been given! __eou__ oh that's wonderful ! i'm so glad for people like you, what do you do to help you cope with it ? __eou__ Just keep my regular doctor visits and thank God - prayer and thankfulness have become a huge part of my life. __eou__ oh thats wonderful, i know your dog may add to your happyness __eou__ He's a terrific companion!  Do you have any pets? __eou__ i am a huge dog lover ! yes i have one, a golden retriever  __eou__ What's his name? __eou__ Goldie, she helps me get through my tough days
that's so cool ! are you sponsored by anyone ? __eou__ not yet , but hopefully soon . do you watch the olympics ? __eou__ Yes, I watch the figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics sections __eou__ Those can be entertaining.  Do you play any sports? __eou__ I play soccer and I dance. __eou__ What kind of dance do you do? __eou__ Ballet, Contemporary, Hip Hop, Jazz, and Musical Theatre. I hate tap, though. That's the only one I don't do __eou__ That sounds like fun.  My sister loves ballet.  Swan Lake is a favorite of hers, obviously. __eou__ It's a really good ballet. __eou__ I saw the movie Black Swan, it seemed like an interesting story. __eou__ Black Swan isn't really the story of Swan Lake though, it focuses on one character who's dancing in the show __eou__ Oh, well, ballet is more my sister's thing. ;) __eou__ Haha yeah, it's a lot tougher than most people understand, too. __eou__ I imagine that's true.  What position do you play in soccer?
How can I trust again when I have ben cheated on thrice __eou__ Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you. __eou__ I have lots of people around me, but how can I avoid choosing the bad ones? __eou__ I would listen to my friend's opinions, even though it's hard to hear. A lot of times they end up being right. __eou__ Should I listen to my parents? They've had an unsuccessful marriage __eou__ Maybe not parents, especially if they're divorced or unhappy. They could be jaded and biased. __eou__ Maybe I could look to some of my friends' parents with successful marriages __eou__ I think that's a good idea. People are just different these days too and less committed to marriage. __eou__ Who do you look for when you need life advice? __eou__ It might sound silly, but I go to Reddit for life advice, lol. :) There's a lot of wise people on there! __eou__ Yes!! I often find myself on reddit too! It's my favorite "social media" platform by far! __eou__ Me too! It reminds me of the "old days" of the internet, where you could talk and be anonymous. __eou__ Ah, yes. The anonymity is great. Strangely, in a lot of cases I feel like people are held more accountable for their comments because of the upvotes/downvotes __eou__ That's true, and the anonymity can actually make people more genuine and vulnerable with each other. __eou__ Nice chatting with you!
i am a truck driver an stopped driving when i married . __eou__ i work as a classically trained chef for a living . __eou__ Did you have long working days as a chef? __eou__ Sometimes, depends on the demand.  __eou__ Being a truck driver was OK, it gave me a bad back though __eou__ Ouch. Did you require surgery? __eou__ It's an ongoing issue, currently trying to manage it with pain medication __eou__ I hope it gets better for you.  __eou__ Tell me about your job, you must have your own injuries working in the kitchen all day __eou__ Just a few burned fingers haha __eou__ Still got all ten then? None got chopped and fell into the soup? __eou__ lol Oh God, no. Luckily I still have all ten.  __eou__ What did you enjoy cooking the most as a chef? Did you specialise in a certain cuisine? __eou__ My lasagna is to kill for. 
My mom watches it, but I've never seen it! Is it a food competition show? __eou__ the show features chefs competing against each other in various culinary challenges  __eou__ do you like to cook? __eou__ I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together. __eou__ what is you favourite dish to make? __eou__ my favourite dish to make is a special called, 'welsh rarebit'. Its simple but with my spin on it, its a dish not to be frowned upon __eou__ yum sounds tasty. Im more into baking, my self. __eou__ Oh right, i bake too sometimes, I create an english breakfast pie,inot very healthy but we all have vices. do you have a favourite?  __eou__ I like a good cheese cake. __eou__ mm very tasty, what brand cheese do you use? i tried Stilton but it wasn't very popular with my 10 adopted children. __eou__ I like to use Philadelphia cream cheese.
My family is gone on vacation without me and I don't like sleeping without anyone else in the house. __eou__ I can understand that. It can be quite scary. __eou__ I asked some of my friends to spend the night while my family is gone. That will help. __eou__ That is a good idea, as long as you do what you prefer. __eou__ I agree. I am also very busy with school work and college, so I should be distracted. __eou__ I can certainly understand that. __eou__ Are you in college? __eou__ No, I graduated a few years ago.  __eou__ Congratulations! What did you study? __eou__ I graduated with a major in business and minor in economics  __eou__ That's great. I just started recently. I am studying chemistry.  __eou__ I really liked chemistry because it allowed me to really try and understand life at a small level. __eou__ That is also why I like chemistry. I am very busy with three science classes, but I am excited to learn more. __eou__ I just think it's cool how chemical elements make up the matter of the universe.
Moved to a new city with a lower cost of living. I kind of feel isolated here __eou__ ohhh, I feel you. I also moved to a new town, last week. __eou__ It's not a tiny city but its pretty small compared. __eou__ I live in a small town also. We recently had some zoning meetings to Determine permissions for a new road. hope they allow running __eou__ Well i am an author so the smaller town has been better for my writing since it is much quieter. __eou__ That's great. What do you write about? fiction or non-fiction ? __eou__ Fiction, mostly scifi things, I really love space and aliens and things like that. __eou__ i like science fiction also . i hope you do well with your writing. whats your latest piece ? __eou__ I am working on a set of space opera novels. __eou__ Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!, where can i see copies of your work ?
sick i just got off work from the candy store __eou__ oh i'm sorry . i'm going to watch sports today . __eou__ now that I'm off work, I'm going to catch up on world news. Do you keep up with news/politics? __eou__ I do, but sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter because I can't change anything. __eou__ Good point. I feel the same way but I do like to know how things are changing me __eou__ That's completely true. It's good to take a break from new though, because it can be depressing. __eou__ Absolutely. What do you like to do when you're feeling down? I like to run. __eou__ I like to play basketball with my friends. Any exercise is great for the mind. __eou__ Sounds like fun! I've never been a basketball player myself but I can appreciate the game __eou__ Yeah, it can be hard to find people to play sports with once you hit adulthood, lol. __eou__ All too true! I suppose that's why I've taken to running __eou__ I want to start running too. Have you ever felt "runner's high"? __eou__ I have on rare occasion. I strive for ~2 miles whenever I run so I'm no long distance runner by any means __eou__ Oh okay, I see. How long do you have to run to get the runner's high usually? __eou__ Depends on the person! I've known others who run 7-8 at a time and have never felt it.
I thought it was just plants and land.  Animals too? __eou__ No. They are used to sustain and enhance life. __eou__ Interesting.. I never knew that, maybe I'm too much of a city person, I'm from Chicago haha __eou__ I'm from Philadelphia.  I suppose most people now live in or nears cities.  A hundred years ago,most people lived on farms. __eou__ Thank god those days are over, it's so much more convenient now I'm sure! __eou__ I agree.  I love to spend time outdoors backpacking and camping, but it is always nice to return to all the modern conveniences.
Whenever I see a happy couple, I get so envious.. __eou__ Aww, that's sad. Do you have a bad relationship or not have one? __eou__ I am currently single and have been for awhile __eou__ That's okay. It's good to take time to be single and understand who you are and what you want in a prtner __eou__ That is so true. I'll find someone one day. I'm in no rush __eou__ That's a really good philosophy. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that they HAVE to find someone as soon as possib;e __eou__ Then they wonder why their relationships are toxic. Some people are crazy __eou__ Yeah, my mom was a social worker and she saw a lot of teens who got into toxic relationships because they rushed it __eou__ You can't love someone else until you love yourself __eou__ That's true __eou__ More people need to realize that and quit looking for fairytale ending __eou__ I agree. Plus the idea that there's the "perfect person" out there is just false. No one's perfect, but if you love them, you'll work through issues together __eou__ Some people can't seem to tell that they are the common denominator __eou__ completely agree . if you can't be happy alone , you'll not be with someone else .
i do not know what that's . __eou__ i love spongebob because i'm a huge fan __eou__ Do you have any kids? __eou__ I have 3. What about you? they are the ones that introduced me to bikini bottom __eou__ I don't have any kids, but I also love spongebob.  __eou__ It is the best show ever made ever in life ever lol, cant get enough of patrick. who is your favorite charachter ? __eou__ Patrick, for sure. He's hilarious. __eou__ spongebob is so funny , he is kind of wield sometime . what kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ Typically rap and R&B, I listen to it almost every day. How about you? __eou__ i like alot more melodious music , more singing.i hardly do rap & r&b __eou__ You should try listening to H.E.R. __eou__ I'm gonna look that up. i've never listened to H.E.R. although i've heard of the artist __eou__ Yeah, she's brilliant. I highly recommend her.  __eou__ i'll take your encouragement. so what do you do ?
just touching up my purple hair . __eou__ that's cool , do you like the beach ? __eou__ Not so much, people often stare at me there because I am a 6 feet talland here in Thailand girls are usually very small __eou__ Oh, wow.  I always wished I was taller than I am.  I'm sorry it makes you uncomfortable. __eou__ Thank you! It's hard to find a partner when most boys are like 5''7 but with my friends i take it with humour :) How tall are you? __eou__ I'm 5'8", which isn't short for a woman, but I always wanted to be just a little bit taller. __eou__ I think thats perfect! A lot of models have such height. Where are you living?  __eou__ I live off the west coast of Florida, so I go to the beach a lot with my children. __eou__ Wow, I want to go to the US someday. My parents could move there once instead moving 40 times to different cities in thailand haha  __eou__ America is a great place.  Lots of different things to see.  I imagine Thailand is beautiful, though. __eou__ I imagine! What places do you like the most around florida? Thailand has really nice places, especially for tourist, but many parts are veery polluted __eou__ I love the beaches on the west coast.  The east coast isn't as pretty, and the water isn't as calm.  There's also Disney World and Universal Studios.  __eou__ I always think of hip hop and gangs when hearing west coast and east coast, no idea why :D Anyways what are working as?  __eou__ Haha, those phrases are used a lot in rap songs.  I'm a stay-at-home mom at the moment. What about you?
Once I had a really scary experience where I was walking home by myself in a city where I was studying abroad, and a man started following me and verbally harassing me. __eou__ Oh no. I would have screamed. __eou__ Yes I kept walking faster and faster trying to ignore the person __eou__ Did he have a weapon? __eou__ I couldn't tell if he had a weapon. I'm always assuming everyone has weapon its kind of a sad society these days __eou__ I think it is very important that our young people do not see this type of stuff. __eou__ Yes I somewhat agree with you but at the same time you keep a young person sheltered if you know what I mean __eou__ Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourselves after this horrific event?
yeah i feel you . i love staying home too and enjoying my family . __eou__ where do you live ? i'm in ny . __eou__ New Orleans, absolutely love the Jazz scene __eou__ It is very nice. It's a nice place for jazz admirers. __eou__ Do you have any pets at home? __eou__ Nope, I plan on getting one after finishing my studies. __eou__ Oh, Interesting! What are you studying? I currently have 3 dogs and a parrot that LOVES to sing __eou__ Currently studying law. I would love to hear you parrot sing! __eou__ Oh wow, you're very intelligent to be studying law! I hope it goes well for you! __eou__ Thank you! It's too bad I don't have a lot of time to go out or anything. __eou__ Constantly studying? __eou__ Yup, studying is very demanding to say the least! __eou__ I haven't studied in a couple of years now, I managed to gain a few qualifications in IT with the big tech wave __eou__ Interesting! What made you want to get into IT, besides the tech wave? __eou__ I used to be a girl but I loved IT, so I made a big decision and changed my gender as I was always getting harrassed
i walked right up to the girl i like today and told her how i felt. i didn't even care what she was going to say, i just love to tell people what i feel __eou__ that's nice, what did she say tho __eou__ she was really responsive and we got along well __eou__ i hope she was happy and said yes ? __eou__ yep, it was crazy __eou__ Are you going to see her again? __eou__ yes, we are hanging out later __eou__ where will you guys be going ? __eou__ we're going to get dinner and then hang out a little bit __eou__ that sounds good __eou__ really good __eou__ great , we will probably dine out afterwards __eou__ yeah, i'm looking forward to some good food __eou__ oh ok
good and you ? i'm 29 and live in the suburb of boston . __eou__ i am well ! excited for my track meet later tonight . __eou__ That is great, I am sure you will do wonderful at the track meet __eou__ Thank you. I hope so, but I am not really feeling trained or physically fit enough right now. __eou__ I know the feeling. But a little bit every day goes a long way! __eou__ Definitely . Maybe if I ate better i'd have more motivation. That is something I am working on. __eou__ I've heard there are websites and apps that help with that, should make it a little easier to get through. __eou__ Any apps you recommend? __eou__ My Fitness Pal has been a favorite of mines for years. Easy to use and very helpful __eou__ Thanks.  i will have to look into it .  I am always open to trying new things. __eou__ Sounds good, I am sure it will be a huge help and you'll be placing first in line! __eou__ Thanks for the extra motivation! __eou__ Anytime! __eou__ I am glad we got to catch up. It was good to talk to you.
Why would you like such a place? It must very hard to live in that area. __eou__ The living conditions in the desert are harsh for animals and plants but its beautiful __eou__ I don't know part of me really wants to go but I just don't think I could handle it __eou__ It took me a while to get use to it, but I ended up loving it. Do you prefer colder weather, with less sun? __eou__ I guess I want something more in the middle. My fiance is from new york but I can't deal with the snow lol __eou__ I don't think I could deal with the extremely fast paced environment. lol The middle sounds about right to me too. Do you visit NY often? __eou__ I've been once. When we were in school she would go up every summer. We're homing to take a trip sometime next year __eou__ I hope you get the chance. I would love to visit the west coast one day. I was born and raised on the east. __eou__ Same honestly. I have some family out in Cali too but I haven't seen them in years __eou__ It looks so beautiful. Seems like a happy place to be. I'd love to visit Washington as well. __eou__ I've actually never been to Washington but I hear a lot of places are nice and quiet __eou__ I don't think I could ever live there because of the rain, but I would love to see the Pacific from the coast. Are you a beach or mountains person? __eou__ I love the beach but actually living at the beach is very busy. Mountains would be a nice change of pace __eou__ 've been in mountains my whole life, and feel like I would love the beach. 
Wow that's a long time. I really wouldn't even know where to begin with that, it seems so complicated.  __eou__ Its not complicated,Since its the smallest and highest-pitched instrument it makes it very easy to use and learn, With regular practice you can learn how to use it in no time. __eou__ Interesting...what instrument is this again? __eou__ The violin.  It is a beautiful sounding instrument. __eou__ Nice! I like to play the flute. Do you play the violin professionally? __eou__ I enjoy listening to the flute.  No, I just play for myself and friends.  How long have you been playing the flute? __eou__ I've played for approximately 8 years. How about you with your instrument? __eou__ I have been playing for close to 40 years, but I did not play much in my twenties and thirties. __eou__ Wow! That's amazing that you've kept with it. I hope to do the same although recently I've been spending my time studying software development __eou__ It is great to be able to play a musical instrument, but we also need to earn a living doing something like you, studying software development. __eou__ I'm fortunate that I'm able to make a good living doing what I enjoy! I know not everyone can say the same. __eou__ Good for you!  When someone enjoys their work, they are much more likely to excel at it.  I bet you are good at it. __eou__ I think I am! Although I like to stay humble. I'm sure you've perfected your craft at the violin! __eou__ I wish I did.  If I had perfected it, I would be playing violin professionally.  I was never dedicated enough to excel at it.
Last week we had a huge storm. A tornado blew through the neighborhood with barely enough time to take cover. __eou__ Was your house okay? __eou__ Yes, barely. A lot of damage was done to the exterior. __eou__ Wow, that sounds terrible! I think for me, the most storm activity in our area was 2010. There were winter storms, hailstorms, flooding, all sorts of terrible weather events. __eou__ Oh wow, did your home make it okay? __eou__ we did. how was your experience ? __eou__ It wasn't great. luckily, insurance paid for most of the damages.  __eou__ That's good! I know insurance can be a pain to deal with! how was your experience with them? __eou__ It was pretty good, I would recommend them if anyone is looking for insurance.  __eou__ that's good to know. how are you doing since that experience ? __eou__ I'm doing great, thanks for asking.  __eou__ You're welcome.  I wish you the best! what do you do for a living ? __eou__ Vendor management. how about you? __eou__ vendor management ? whats that ?
i do recycle when i've the time __eou__ cool . are you busy most of the time ? __eou__ no no.. i am free out of worktime. __eou__ do you enjoy recycling?  its groovy I think __eou__ yaes. __eou__ what kind of vehicle do you drive? __eou__ no. __eou__ i recycle __eou__ oh ok good. __eou__ what kind of stuff do you recycle __eou__ No. do not recycle __eou__ i recycle plastic __eou__ oh that is pollution affect  __eou__ yep
that is an awesome family you got there . where are you from ? __eou__ i live in colorado , what about you ? __eou__ I live in Toronto  __eou__ I been to Toronto! It's a cool place. __eou__ It is very nice! Although it does get cold for most of the year. __eou__ It must be different if you live where it is cold most of the time in the year. __eou__ Yes it is. I do use my vacation time to go to hotter places. __eou__ Where do you go for your vacations? __eou__ My favourite place is Jamaica! __eou__ Jamaica is a wonderful place. The people of Jamaica are free spirited like me. __eou__ Yes it really is. The people are very friendly. They are all about having a good time. __eou__ I would love to go to Jamaica in the future. __eou__ It should definitely be on your radar to go! __eou__ I can't wait to go there sometime.
i do proofreading for hallmark __eou__ i can not wait to retire . __eou__ I have been dreaming about retiring since I started my first job at 16 __eou__ I totally feel the same. I am over working. I need a break. __eou__ I know what you mean. I just hope all this hard work really does pay off at the end. If not, there is always whiskey __eou__ I am more of a wine kind of girl. I like to relax at home, listen to some Rolling stones, and have a glass of wine.  __eou__ Sounds like a pretty good night. For me, nothing like cuddling up with my puppy and watch a movie. The small things are the best things __eou__ I agree. That also sounds like a peaceful way to spend an evening. __eou__ Yep, after a long day of working there is no better way to unwind __eou__ Nice. What kind of dog do you have? __eou__ I have a little maltese. His name is Samwise Gamgee but I just call him Sam for short. He is my everything! __eou__ LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future. __eou__ By all means go for it!  I hope to eventually get him a little brother or sister and have a little fellowship __eou__ I am sure he would appreciate that. Then you can all cuddle and watch a movie together.
The latest economic numbers which shows the lowers unemployment rate in more than a decade makes me feel hopeful of Trump's policies __eou__ That's great that unemployment is down. __eou__ Yeah but was it trumps doing or was it a side effect from the Obama administration? __eou__ Who really knows?  I think it's best just to be thankful that things seem to be going in a positive direction. __eou__ Yeah I tend to agree with that, now if we could just get the environment going in a better direction. __eou__ I agree.  It would be nice if people would be a bit more considerate of our planet.  __eou__ I'm not sure who i dislike more, anti vaxxers or climate deniers. Both parties are going to be our downfall. __eou__ Both are aggravating.  The two party system of our government will be the downfall.  It's dividing America. __eou__ yeah the two party system is horrible but I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. __eou__ No, I don't think so either.  It's unfortunate, I think most people don't see that as the problem.  It gets me pretty depressed sometimes. __eou__ I think Party over policy is a huge problem. Just look at all the stuff going on with the Trump administration at the moment. __eou__ No one wants to look at a "problem" and choose a sensible solution. People want to pick according to what "their side" has chosen to be the answer. __eou__ I also think the electoral college is a pretty big issue that needs to be addressed.  __eou__ Probably.  I don't know a whole lot about it, but that's an issue my husband has mentioned to me before.  He's more knowledgeable.
I have an irrational fear of flying which I faced when I traveled 8 hours on a plane by myself  __eou__ Good for you! I'm glad you were able to face it by yourself. Where were you flying? __eou__ To the Bahamas __eou__ That is a good place to have as a destination to accomplish getting over your fear of flying! __eou__ What places have you been on an airplane? __eou__ I have been to Mexico, England and other states in the USA. I enjoy flying, but I didn't always. Have you flown again? __eou__ I have not.  The opportunity has not presented itself as of yet __eou__ Would you be willing to go again? __eou__ Possibly, if the time and destination were right. __eou__ It is awesome that you have conquered your fear! I try to practice the techniques I've learned from yoga to help me with my fears. __eou__ I ten to run to help myself relax and deal with stress. __eou__ That's how my son likes to deal with his stress, poor kid is in high school and thinks life is hard! Shew __eou__ I feel sometimes the pressures for children are too great.   __eou__ I agree. Kids can't be kids anymore! It is a shame
It makes me think of the good old days when I was a kid when I listen to the music in my aunts car __eou__ What does? Were you in a car ride with your aunt? __eou__ felling the wind on my face when i run __eou__ I can see how that could be soothing if you didn't get motion sickness __eou__ do you run / __eou__ I love running, but it needs to be in the right area. You? __eou__ it's my enjoyment , my stress reliever.  __eou__ That is a great stress reliever. How far do you normally run? __eou__ bout 4 miles easy, i like to run when its cool and windy __eou__ Wow. I only make it about a mile, mile and a half.  When I have time. __eou__ its all in the mind , once you can believe it you can do it __eou__ Do you like any other sports? __eou__ not really,  __eou__ oh , do you listen to music while you run ? __eou__ i do , helps encourage me __eou__ What are some of your favorites? __eou__ r&b preferably, what about you ? __eou__ Sublime mostly. __eou__ ok sound nice
I think the Williams sisters are fun to follow __eou__ Yes. Serena is an all time great. She has been #1 for 319 weeks. __eou__ That's a long time to be on top. Do you like any other sports? __eou__ Pretty much every single sport, but especially basketball. __eou__ Do you have a favorite team? Do you prefer college or professional? __eou__ it is tough to have a favorite player , but i've a team ! do you ? __eou__ Yes, I am a fan of the Washington Wizards. I like all Washington teams. __eou__ i prefer the mavericks myself . __eou__ I have nothing against them. Did/do you play any sports? __eou__ Yes, I played basketball and soccer, and I am also a varsity swimmer __eou__ You sound like quite the athlete. I honestly just recently learned how to swim. __eou__ it is a great skill to have , do you play sports ? __eou__ No, I use to play football though. __eou__ Did you play college football? I hear its one step from professional
that is a lot of people __eou__ yeah , my parents are teachers and they work as high school teachers . __eou__ High school teachers are very valuable __eou__ Indeed they are. They are the last ones to prepare students for college and the "real world." __eou__ My history teacher was also my basketball coach.  __eou__ Was he better at teaching or coaching? __eou__ Coaching.  He inspired me to play in college. __eou__ How did that go? Where did you go? __eou__ UTEP __eou__ I've never heard of that, where is that? __eou__ University of Texas El Paso __eou__ Oh nice! Did you like the school? __eou__ I did! __eou__ I've never been to Texas. How was the culture there?
Yeah, you're right. I think that's why I'm so fascinated when I see foreign languages. The meaning we connect to images or orders of symbols are so interesting __eou__ well most people think that reading is a means of language acquisition, communitcaition and sharing of information and i deas __eou__ It absolutely is. I feel like sharing information is one of the things that make us human __eou__ Yes I agree. I particularly enjoy how stories are a means to communicate information through groups, families and even centuries  __eou__ Couldn't say it better myself. I'd love to take the time to learn another language __eou__ I tend to have a scientific brain so they can be tricky to get my head around as they never follow a certain pattern. __eou__ Its interesting you say that because english is actually a pretty broken language in and of itself  __eou__ They say it is the most difficult language to learn as a second language due to it's lack of order.  __eou__ Yeah that is true. The only reason its spoken worldwide is because of Britain's history as a world power __eou__ I sometimes wonder if it is just because the English are so terrible at learning languages! __eou__ I mean all things considered that wouldn't surprise me at all __eou__ What is the most surprising thing you have found out recently? __eou__ Well I found out that English is a weird mix of german and french If you use the same sound for each vowel I saw a video on it  __eou__ That is interesting and it just made me try and sound words out!
oh i did wrestling back in the day __eou__ i took them to see a match in new york city once __eou__ thats grate __eou__ Did you do wrestling for entertainment or for competition. __eou__ yes i do __eou__ I was thriiled to find out that Wrestling dates back to early '50s __eou__ oh wow you are so thriiled  __eou__ Yeah!

mine is to draw allday __eou__ that is so cool what do you draw ? __eou__ I draw my siblings. __eou__ Nice, how many siblings do you have? __eou__ I have 5! __eou__ Wow! That must have been a busy house growing up! __eou__ It really was.  Lots of laundry for my poor mom. __eou__ I can't even imagine! I cut down trees and there is always so much sawdust in my laundry! __eou__ I ride a bike, and there is always mud on my clothes.  My wife does not like it haha __eou__ I bet not! Mud comes along with cutting the tress too, I try to avoid it as best I can! __eou__ Have you found any solutions for getting dirt stains out of clothes? __eou__ The best thing I have found is to soak them prior to throwing them in the washer. __eou__ Very nice.  I will try that! __eou__ I hope it works! You can also google to see if there are any other ideas!
cool , i love hot dogs with mac and cheese . i also enjoy a good fish fillet . __eou__ cool . . what are your hobbies ? ? __eou__ I like video games and cars. __eou__ I like video games, too.  Although, I'm not so great at them.  Which ones do you like to play? __eou__ I like super mario cart. What is your favorite video game? __eou__ Oh, I love that one, too.  My most favorite was a computer MMO, Lord of the Rings. __eou__ Cool. I like MMO as well, League of Legends. __eou__ I've heard of that one, but never played it.  I also liked Silent Hill, way back in the day. __eou__ I have seen the movie Silent Hill. It was really scary. __eou__ Yeah, I love scary movies, so the game was right up my alley.  I don't get to play much anymore now that I have kids. __eou__ That's too bad. You can still play it once in a while. __eou__ Yes, I do still get to every now and then.  I can't complain.  I knew that once I had kids, I didn't get to be one anymore. ;) __eou__ Yeah, kids come with great responsibilities. But also great joys. __eou__ For sure.  We have good times.  I enjoy spending quality time with them.  They won't be little forever and then there will be plenty of me time.
she became religious after having all of us:) __eou__ Yes she had a high fertility factor since she apparently liked children and wanted to have a lot __eou__ I wonder if there are other things effecting fertility, especially in the modern world  __eou__ i'm not sure , but i believe your diet has some influence __eou__ They used to say that diet specifically effected if you had a boy or a girl. It is odd to see what they used to believe.  __eou__ I am not sure I believe them most of the time though __eou__ I think most have them have been disproved by science now. Except alcohol decreasing fertility __eou__ That's an interesting theory that doesn't sound inaccurate. Nowadays Western culture often celebrate good news in groups by drinking a few. do you have children __eou__ Yes I do. They are grown up now though. What about you? __eou__ I have a daughter but she isn't married (yet). she is the apple of my eye __eou__ Aww that is lovely. Are you waiting for a proposal and marriage then? __eou__ it all depends on here , are you married ? __eou__ Yes 35 years. What about you? __eou__ i've been . it was a great
I would highly recommend it, but not because it is popular. __eou__ i know that it makes up a majority of the population in 158 countires and territories __eou__ That is true and there's so many ways to practice and study the faith  __eou__ I am really not a religious person. I am present in there here and now and find happiness and peace in the little things in life. __eou__ Honestly what more can you ask for? I strive for that level of spiritualism in my daily life  __eou__ That is interesting. I like your perspective and that you strive for that. __eou__ Yeah. I think that I've struggled with personal peace in the past. I think your outlook would help with that __eou__ I understand and can relate it. I appreciate the positve words. Do you ever meditate? __eou__ No actually I don't currently. Do you think I should? __eou__ yes I think that it has a lot of health benefits but also it has a meditative and spiritual core __eou__ That does make sense. I've also heard that different types of exercise can sometimes help with that as well __eou__ Exercise is a good stress reliever and mood lifter. __eou__ Facts. I used to run a lot as a kid. the high would get was unbelievable __eou__ I started running again about 3 years ago. I definitely get it. It does feel good and also good for stress. 
No, but I do like sci-fi style games. What else do you know about this interesting game? __eou__ It's set 200 years after humans colonized Mars, during what's known as the War of Water. Seems pretty interesting to me. __eou__ Yes.  That is very interesting. __eou__ Do you enjoy video games? __eou__ Oh Yes.  __eou__ I love video games. __eou__ I also like video games. __eou__ Which platform do you use? ie. the electronic system used to play video games. __eou__ I use to playstation. __eou__ old or new version ? i love playing on both . did you get the new old system ? __eou__ I like only new version. __eou__ What is your favourite game? __eou__ My favorite game is god of war 5. __eou__ I have never seen it nor played it. I do love God of war though, it's such a good game.
My new Tesla drove on autopilot effortlessly on the highway.  __eou__ Amazing. Is that even legal though? __eou__ As long as you don't fall asleep. LOL __eou__ That's awesome! They don't have them in Canada yet, hoping soon! __eou__ It is a great car.  No gas cost and helping the environment. Win Win. __eou__ I agree! Seems like you like it so far. Any bad parts of it? __eou__ The electric bill has gone up as well as the insurance cost. I still don't "trust" the autopilot completely. __eou__ So your home electric fuels the car? Yeah I don't know how comfortable I would be with the autopilot.  __eou__ Tesla has become really popular here. They are just very expensive. __eou__ I wonder if the price will go down after they have been out for a while, I hope so at least.\ __eou__ Maybe.   __eou__ Do you like basketball? It's my favorite sport! __eou__ Basketball is okay.  I like gymnastics better. __eou__ Gymnastics is cool. It seems really hard though, especially for me...I have no balance. 
i've a husband and two kids . __eou__ what do you do for a living ? i'd like to be a journalist someday . __eou__ even i. i work from home __eou__ That's awesome!

Where is your favorite place to go? __eou__ my favorite place is banff its located in canada i just love that place and what about you? __eou__ My favorite place I've ever been in Pensacola FL. Warm, lovely beaches. Alcohol and seafood! __eou__ oh great! what is your hobby? __eou__ Writing. Who could have guessed from a girl studying writing aiming to go into journalism. I love to write fictional stories.
Are there skills necessary to make one a good reader? __eou__ Yes.  For good readers, however, the skills seem easy as they are learned at such a young age. __eou__ It is so much easier to loarn something young. Same with sports and other things. Much harder later in life. __eou__ Agreed.  However, I made the most advancement later than usual when learning to read.  It was very hard for me. __eou__ Why do you think that was? __eou__ I had a learning disability that was mild enough to go unnoticed for several years in elementary school. __eou__ I have heard from a lot of people that they have experienced that. Did you get good help when it was noticed? __eou__ Yes, in the 5th grade I had an amazing teacher that noticed the problem and helped me.  At the time, I read on about a 1st grade level. __eou__ I feel like most people remember their favourite teacher for the rest of their lives. They make such a difference. __eou__ I agree.  She was very special to me.  She even came to my wedding. __eou__ That is lovely!  __eou__ Her help was invaluable to me.  I am a great reader now and love to do it in any spare time I can find. __eou__ Reading is such a great escape from normal life. It is great that you had that support.  __eou__ Yes, I agree.  I love fiction.  How about you?
My 10 year old cat is starting to get sick a lot. I'm worried about her. __eou__ Has she had a history of illness? __eou__ No, this is her first illness.  __eou__ Well maybe it's due to her age. I'd take her to the vet maybe it isn't that serious __eou__ yes, hopefully. I will take her in for a check up tomorrow.  __eou__ I'm sure she'll be okay. They don't say that cats have 9 lives for nothing __eou__ Lol agreed. She's my baby. Do you have any pets? __eou__ I have a great dane actually. She's a lot of work if I'm being honest __eou__ So I've heard. Great danes are really energetic __eou__ Yeah but there also pretty easy to train if they like you  __eou__ So I guess the battle is getting them to like you. Is it a boy or a girl? __eou__ A girl and actually its easier than you think. Sure they're stubborn but they're pretty gentle giants __eou__ Aww, how old is she? __eou__ um... I think she's a year and a half now. feels like forever
1894?  Wow, that is a long time?  It is a U.S. company? __eou__ Yes it is an American company and the headquarters are in Hershey, Pennsylvania actually. __eou__ I would love to visit there.  I love chocolate so much!  __eou__ I have been there. The streetlights looks like hershey kisses. __eou__ That is so cool.  Do they have rides like roller coasters? __eou__ They do. It is all very cool. __eou__ That sounds like a great place to visit.  I should go sometime __eou__ You should. Where do you live? __eou__ In the west.  Nevada __eou__ I have been there. I like it. Do you live near Vegas? __eou__ No, more in the north.  But I have been  many times __eou__ I am getting ready to go to the gym. I meant to go earlier but I got distracted. __eou__ I spent my gym time watching anime.   __eou__ That works. I love the japanation or hand-drawn computer animation. Have you seen Cowboy Bebop?
i have not is it a fun place ? __eou__ have not been there yet . love traveling to jamaica though . that's the spot . __eou__ really / how is the weather / __eou__ Not too bad right now but it gets really hot. I have been there in the summer and it is almost unbearable.  __eou__ wow! would love to visit there. what are some of the fun places ? __eou__ I would suggest Fiji it's so nice there I went in august! It is very touristy so there are tons of fun things to do.  __eou__ ok , i prefer the caribian though  __eou__ Really? And why is that? __eou__ it just so foregin to me  __eou__ Is it a safe place to travel to these days though? __eou__ i know , i see the travel agencies advertising them all the time __eou__ Hmm, that doesn't really answer my question. But if travel agencies advertise for that place I would hope it would be safe.  __eou__ well i guess its safe, since there aren't any deterrents  __eou__ Are there any other places you would like to go?  __eou__ Europe for sure
i was mad when i saw my dog was missing __eou__ oh no. did you find it? __eou__ I had him for over 10 years but when we moved he got and went missing. I was devastated but we did eventually find him. __eou__ That's great, losing a pet would have been awful as I have recently got a pet myself which is the best aquaincence I could ever ask for. __eou__ Well make sure you get him chipped because that is the best way to find a lost pet. __eou__ Most definitely! Being creative is forte as an artist as I do love my new pet, I will definitely get him chipped. __eou__ Yeah a lot of people consider their pets to be their children. I think pets have a huge impact on peoples life. __eou__ YES exactly! I agree and sometimes they're taken for granted. Luckily I was able to rescue a poor cat recently who was desperate. Have you ever rescued an animal? __eou__ When I was younger my neighbors kid threw a kitten into a creek in the middle of winter. I got her and nursed her back to health. __eou__ WOW! That's perfection... I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats, like the cat I recently got. __eou__ Cats do seem to be tossed out much more than dogs are, at least in my experience and i don't know why because cats can be awesome pets.  __eou__ Maybe because domestication has to do with mutual relationships. I believe it as a painter, It always seems to me that we need cats more than they need us. __eou__ I owned a domesticated lynx house cat hybrid that lived to be 18 and i can for sure say she didn't need us at all most times haha.
I stubbed my toe today __eou__ Did you call a tow truck? LOL. __eou__ No, but it looks really bruised.  I might have to do a YouTube video on it later. __eou__ Oh no! I am sorry to hear that! Do you think maybe you should go to the doctor? __eou__ It looks way worse than it feels, but I may need to keep an eye on it. __eou__ I definitely would, but I'm no doctor, I didn't even finish high school.  __eou__ I was thinking if I did a video, someone in the comments might know why it's so discolored. __eou__ That's an innovative way to use technology! __eou__ Oh, it's crazy.  Someone always knows something you don't in the comments.  With my channel growing, there's bound to be someone that knows. __eou__ I am sure someone will be able to help you! __eou__ I hope so.  Actually I hope this bruise just starts looking better after I've had some sleep. __eou__ I hope so too. Have you iced it? __eou__ Yeah, I've had ice on it all day.  Well, all day since it happened.  I've just been taking it easy now. __eou__ That's good! I would be laid up reading a good book if I hurt myself! I love reading!

Have you always had dogs?
I'm afraid to check my messages. The last line I saw from my friend is "we broke up" __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that, you got to check though. __eou__ What should I say to them? __eou__ I would check your messages anyway. It's better to know than to keep yourself hanging __eou__ I will. How do I help my friend through the breakup? __eou__ Well, at the end of the day theres nothing anyone can do unless that person themselves wants the help :\ __eou__ You're right, everyone deals with it in different ways. __eou__ Yeah for some people it's really hard to move on. Good thing there are psychologist. I'm stressed myself because of the three jobs that I've been working. __eou__ what jobs do you work? __eou__ Just a few different jobs really, just anything that will get the bills paid.

I usually walk about two miles a day. __eou__ Walking is the best! I like to walk down by the lake. __eou__ Walking in nature is amazing and there are so many health benefits from walking!
Oh no! That is very sad. Can you do anything about it. __eou__ Sadly, no.  The developer has bought the property from the farm owner.  :(  I will miss my fields and forest areas. __eou__ I am very sorry about that.  I would be so sad if that happened in the area I live. __eou__ Luckily we have already mapped out National Parks and Forests to preserve a small part of the Earth. Do you have any of these near where you live? __eou__ There are some places like that near me. Several parks that are protected. __eou__ Can you purchase some sort of an entry pass for all the parks from the national park service? __eou__ Yes, there are a few that require a pass that you purchase and a few that are paid for by taxes and free to enter. __eou__ have you been to any of them? if so, how are they? __eou__ Yes, I've gone to most of them as there isn't much else to do in my area.  They are all nice and give you a taste of untouched Florida.
My dog ran out of the house into the street the other day. Luckily my neighbor was there and caught him for me. __eou__ oh my goodness, i would freak if my dog ran out, he is like another child of ours __eou__ He is so bad, I need to take him to some obedience training classes.  __eou__ That's always a good idea. Hopefully getting him some training will keep him in the house lol __eou__ Lol right. What kind of dog do you have? __eou__ He's some kind of pitbull mix. That's why I worry about him getting out. They're a bit misunderstood __eou__ Yes, absolutely. They get a bad rep from the mainstream media.  __eou__ It's funny because all the ones I've had are terrified of everything __eou__ Lol that's too cute. I want a pitbull puppy, but later in life.  __eou__ They adorable as puppies and they're really good family dogs __eou__ So I've heard, I can't wait to get one.  __eou__ Honestly I want another one. My big guy seems like he's been getting bored lol __eou__ lol yes, another one will probably bring him great joy.  __eou__ Absolutely. and it would be better than getting him a cat 
i wish i could make money on youtube . __eou__ most people would . it helps me get the ladies . __eou__ does that make good money? __eou__ I depends on the content and views I guess. __eou__ Just need to train my dogs to do something viral worthy. then I'd make it on youtube. __eou__ That would be one way. Pets doing stupid or interesting things is big. __eou__ Right? I wonder how many followers I would need. __eou__ I suppose you could google it. I'm sure there is an online guide. __eou__ hmmm. looks like you need at least 1,000 to monetize the account. i think I'd rather spend my free time swimming. do you have any pets? __eou__ Sure. Two dogs, a cat and a parrot. How about you? __eou__ Just my 4 dogs. They keep me busy but I love them. __eou__ I have four pets but being different species they each have unique quirks. __eou__ Must be nice to have the variety! I want to get a cat one day. A big fluffy one. Pets are the best. __eou__ Sure are. I don't know what I would do without them.
Green is an interesting color. It is the color of nature. __eou__ Yellow is used in painting or color printing. __eou__ I love yellow. Something about it is calming and mood-lifting to me. __eou__ It reminds me of sinshine. __eou__ That makes sense.  __eou__ My wife used to wear yellow to work every Monday __eou__ Nice. Was there a specific reason she did that? __eou__ She was a teacher, and it made her think positive about it being Monday __eou__ I like that. That is a good approach. It is hard to feel positive about Mondays. __eou__ It started to rub off on her students and the day went better!  __eou__ That makes me smile. Talking to you has helped cheer me up a little. Thank you. __eou__ You are so welcome!  __eou__ Do you ever feel down? __eou__ Sometimes.  I have to try and think positively to cheer myslef up __eou__ Yes, thinking positive does help.

I agree that it is terrible.  It tears families apart.  It seems really complicated from a legal standpoint as well. __eou__ It most places divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process __eou__ It is heartbreaking especially when children are involved. __eou__ It is, but we can learn from them and not do the same thing. __eou__ Agreed.  Communication is vital in a marriage.  __eou__ Yes, interpersonal communication is the most important factor in any relationship. __eou__ And putting the other's needs ahead of your own can help a marriage survive as well __eou__ That is true.

I've watched a few dramas here and there too __eou__ I like the suspenseful horror movies, but not the "boo" scary ones.  __eou__ Honestly same. Like the jump scares and stuff are too straight forward __eou__ Yeah and I feel like they aren't authentic. Man I wish  __eou__ Exactly its always missing something. Have you seen Hush? __eou__ It sounds familiar, but I don't think I have seen it. I wish I didn't have to work and could just watch movies all day! __eou__ Facts honestly. But if you get a chance its about this deaf writer and she ends up trapped in her house by a killer and is trying to survive/escape __eou__ Sounds interesting!! I will look into it! Thank you! __eou__ No problem It's a really good take on the basic serial killer horro movie

Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want. __eou__ That's a good way of looking at it.  I've been repairing cars for so long that I'm not even worried about the job itself. __eou__ I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars. __eou__ I've been doing it since I was little.  It was something my father showed me. __eou__ With all the road trips I take with my animals It would be a valuable trade to learn! __eou__ Oh definitely.  I've got a German Shepard that loves road trips.   __eou__ I have a friend who has one of those! Very very smart and playful. I am looking to get a dog soon, for now we just have 2 cats. __eou__ My girl, Ginger is great.  She's so smart and playful and she gets along great with the cats.  __eou__ Such great dogs. We have a cat for now to take care of any vermin in the house which my dog wasn't able to back before she passed. __eou__ Cats are very useful and great to have around.  They are so easy to take care of too.  Mine walk around like they own the place. __eou__ I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be! __eou__ I think the same thing every time I head out the door for work and see them all sprawled out without a care in the world, haha. __eou__ Hah, that reminds me of Sylvester & Tweety. Cats are also valued for their companionship.

Are you a mechanic? __eou__ ummer in 5th grade i broke my nose and helped my dad fix our car so i know a little. I would have preferred to read twilight at that age __eou__ Being in the fifth grade and getting an early start on learning is great but it's better to follow your passions. Is twilight your favorite book? __eou__ For sure one of my favorites, but I agree- always follow your passion! __eou__ I like to read Anne Rice and the Twilight series too! __eou__ Love anne rice!

Relaxation sounds great LOL __eou__ Why is it a pain? __eou__ We are both so hardheaded when it comes to thinking up new ideas for flavors we always clash, just like when we were kids. __eou__ That is unfortunate, it is important to be able to compromise.

I lost my job and was in danger of losing my home to foreclosure. My family loaned me money and saved me from that. __eou__ Well ... I put myself in your place and I admire you because it is something very emotionally tense __eou__ Yes that must be very emotionally tense, as for my case I tend to get very frustrated whilst driving with my daughters. __eou__ Children can be a driving distraction. __eou__ Yes, they can be very distracting. My 2 daughters are very noisy as they anger me. __eou__ That's why the summer is brutal because they are always around. By September it's time for school and no more entertaining them. __eou__ Oh yes! However, the drive to school is no fun. Just makes me more angry when my daughters argue with each other. __eou__ That's why I gave mine tablets so they can play games and watch shows. __eou__ Yes, I suppose that would work and make me less frustrated during the daily drive to school and I'm pretty sure that my daughters would appreciate that. __eou__ I think that would be healthy for everyone involved. How old are your children? __eou__ My youngest daughter is 4 and my oldest daughter is 6. Although they are very adorable, they can make me very angry whilst driving them.

Do you like tofu?
Yeah, it has religious links, but I tell most of my students that it's mainly for low impact exercise.  I'm not running a church here, heh. __eou__ The way I see it is a spiritual oneness with the self and the world around you. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism all revolve around that thought in relation to yoga. __eou__ Whatever works for you! __eou__ I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box. __eou__ I think we all feel that way at some point. __eou__ Right! But the difference with me is I just think about myself and no one else really. People consider it a social and cultural problem. __eou__ I can't say I relate to that. How do you feel about it? __eou__ At first I didn't like it, but honestly as time and the years go by, I feel like we are more and more cohesive. __eou__ Who is we? I thought you only cared about yourself. __eou__ Sorry, I call myself we when I had one too many drinks. I have the ability to care for others on occasion. __eou__ LOL. Sort of like the Royal We. What are you drinking? __eou__ Yes, the Royal we! I am drinking Modelo because thats what my coworkers at roofing inc. drink. __eou__ I hope they don't drink while doing the Roofing!! __eou__ Lol well some people can sneak in drinks but I'm not too sure if its allowed. I usually just order a tea, which they do have.

I attend bars for fun when I'm not studying __eou__ ah, the perfect customer, ahaha. i try to get out when i can too, im a closet taylor swift fan, so try to get to see her when i can __eou__ I love her too. She is awesome!!! __eou__ favourites tracks? __eou__ I love I kissed a girl  __eou__ great song, my favourites are shake it off and bad blood, the 1989-2014 album is great. __eou__ I meant naughty by nature, not Katy Perry's song __eou__ haha, didnt even notice that! __eou__ Sorry about that.

Dr. Suess. I loved those books and shows, especially the Grinch. __eou__ Yep Dr Seuss published it back in 1960 __eou__ In my families restruant that i work at we actually did a green eggs and ham day and it was a big hit! __eou__ Oh wow, actual green eggs and ham that you can eat? __eou__ Yes, the trick is just green food dye lol, tastes all the same!

What's your favorite food __eou__ steak fajitas for sure, spaghetti is a top 5 though! __eou__ I nearly set fire to my kitchen one time whilst making spaghetti - I was a pretty dumb chef 5 years ago.

I'm in the UK, although looking to move to the US for engineering work in a year or two.

Do you spend a lot of time there? __eou__ i do! it's a lot of fun but it can be tiring sometimes __eou__ I can imagine. what kind of restaurant do they own? __eou__ kind of a general place. it's popular for lunch, a lot of soup and sandwiches and stuff, and desserts. soul food i guess? __eou__ yummy.!

Where was your last trip to? __eou__ We traveled to South Africa and are planning a trip to Ireland next year. How about y'all? __eou__ Wow! We went to Grand Canyon last summer. I lived there for 5 years, so we went back to see friends. Ireland! That sounds great.  __eou__ We would love to do a cross country road trip.  Grand Canyon sounds fun.   __eou__ It was a great place to live. I could see the canyon from my office window. I miss it.  __eou__ That sounds like quite a view.

I just found out I was accepted into medical school!  I have been working hard for this chance to become a surgeon __eou__ Congratulations. What a wonderful achievement. If I could do it all over again, this is what I'd want to do too. __eou__ Since I got accepted I really want to quit my job and find a new one. But the school fees are not going to pay themselves __eou__ Indeed, if i could have it my way I would enjoy the warm weather and go for a stroll while reading a nice book for the rest of my life! __eou__ Do you work? Because my Boss is so strict __eou__ I do not work right not, just collecting my retirement living on a lake! Really? What does your boss do? __eou__ He always cuts my breaks short and gives me twice as much work __eou__ That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work! __eou__ I'm pretty sure he would just reject me. Last time I asked for somethin, I nearly lost my temper with the way he was treating me __eou__ Try to just keep pushing because after all, you need the money for medical school. __eou__ I probably should look for another job if i cant secure better pay __eou__ That is very true as well. If you can put in the work, you can achieve anything. __eou__ I sure hope I do __eou__ I believe you will too!
What are the other primary colors? __eou__ I believe green and red. Blue lies between green and violet on the visible light spectrum. __eou__ Blue is my favorite color. It's calming.  __eou__ I believe it is. I painted my daughters room blue because of it __eou__ My sons room was in yellow because we didn't know what he was going to be before he was born. I wish I had know now.  __eou__ I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid? __eou__ My room as a kid was mostly green and had a Woodsy Owl theme. What about you? __eou__ awesome. I have short pink hair, I guess Ill dye my hair blue soon lol __eou__ I wish I had the guts to have short pink hair. Right now, I'm just trying to hide the gray! You are brave. __eou__ thank you for saying that , i'm sure deep down you are brave too. That's a fact :) smile :) __eou__ I'm smiling. I'm brave in other ways, guess. My  job would't let me have pink hair anyway. What do you do? __eou__ I work from home so I guess that;'s a plus. Im a data developer __eou__ Nice. I'm a restuarant manager, learning how to be a transcriptionist so I can work from home.  __eou__ oh wow that's so cool . certainly job security in this age . way to go!!!
I can't face my wife, I had a child out of my one night stand __eou__ Oh my goodness!

I'm sorry you're going through this __eou__ that's ok, i have to face up to the responsibility now. i'll bet your life isn't as complicated lol __eou__ Well, yes and no. There's ups and downs, but you get used to the responsibilities. Just expect more stress from your wife than anything else. __eou__ i think she'll understand, i hope so anyway. she was there for me when i was really low. __eou__ I am sure she will.

I must admit that I have not been a very good father, I feel bad __eou__ Why do you say that __eou__ I spend too much time away from home. __eou__ Accepting that your shortcomings as a father is the first step forward. You should spend time with your kids __eou__ Well, I am too busy at work __eou__ Try managing your time better. Relaxing and spending time with your family can improve your productivity at work __eou__ I know I work on a cruise ship and I only get 2 months off  __eou__ what do you do in those 2 months that you get? __eou__ I spend time with my parents. __eou__ and what about your kids? do you get them along to meet their grandparents? __eou__ sometimes, but me and my wife are in a divorce. __eou__ You should try and reason with your wife why those two months is the only time you get to spend with your kids __eou__ she only lets me see them one week out of the too months. __eou__ Wow that's really frustrating.
